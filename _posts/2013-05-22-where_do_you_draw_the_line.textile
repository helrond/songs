where do you draw the line
At the flagpole or the shrine
where do you draw the line
On the cross, the crescent or the hills of time

bottom line

You pick them up from your father
You learn them in your school
You catch them in churches and hospitals
And they run you around like a fool

I'm trying to forget all of mine
