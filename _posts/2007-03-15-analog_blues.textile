I was born with a digital mind and analog skin
All the places I can stand have gone to the wind
But none of this, none of this, none of this
Can bring me down

I am a scientist; I draw my dreams
From the deep and tainted wells of anthropology
But none of this, none of this, none of this
Can bring me down

I was born with a face belonging to history
And in a crowded room I am a refugee
But none of this, none of this, none of this
Can bring me down

I left this city and a concrete soul
Haunted by languages and staggering with hope
And none of this, none of this, none of this
Will bring me down
