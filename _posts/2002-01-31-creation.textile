<div class="notes">Words by Clement Arnold, music by Hillel Arnold</div>

As I look down at the rushing stream, shining waves of blue
I think of God's creation, how he made it all for you
So I look up at the shining sky to see a flock of geese fly
By, and a beautiful sunset span the sky

<div class="chorus">God's Creation
God's Creation is the best thing a man can see
God's Creation
God's Creations is the best thing there will ever be</div>

Slowly the sun sinks down behind the hills
But a bit of color still remains
Slowly the night sky covers all the plains
The stars light my way as I walk homeward
