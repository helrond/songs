Write me a song, sing it all day long  
Write me a song, sing it out  
Write it down, let the world know your sound  
Write it down, tell the world where you've been and where you're bound

Build me a ship for the stars, for the seas  
Build me a ship for the sky  
Build it proud, let it sail the world around  
Build it proud, let it sail forever never run aground

Tell me a tale of knights and of whales  
Tell me a tale with no end  
Tell it now, who is lost, what you've found  
Tell it now, let your voice be thunder the world, the sound

Dream me a world of wings and wheels  
Dream me a world, make it real  
Dream out loud, let the universe resound  
Dream out loud, tell the world that this is holy ground
