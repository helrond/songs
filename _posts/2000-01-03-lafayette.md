God how this city this city is rusting this  
City is turning to stone  
Doesn't it do wonders to your heart and your body  
When you grow the seeds that are sown

Does violence breed in these paint chipped walls these  
Piss-soaked carpets these dark desolate halls  
There are some people who don't know this reality but  
If this isn't real, then who are we

<div class="chorus">God lives on Lafayette  
Do you  
Girl lives on Lafayette  
Do you</div>

Some will say that's the way it's go to be  
Forget to mention "it's fine as long as it's not me"  
Instant gratification, fast acting pain relief  
For everything except what really hurts, and you can see

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The man on top only sees what he's got to lose  
Down below, it's hard to know which drug to choose  
I'm somewhere in between looking out on this town  
Not sure if I'm going up or down
