When I woke you were closer when I woke you were near
When I woke the clouds had lifted and the hurricane was here
When I woke I saw the rainbow touch down on my bed
When I woke the heavens opened but it was not raining bread

<div class="chorus">How can you say you love someone when you don't know their name
How can you tell your heart to bleed when it don't feel no shame
How can you say you want me when you don't know where I've been
How can I say I won't go there again</div>

When I woke I was a liar when I woke I was playing the fool
When I woke I found the promised land under foreign rule
When I woke I was a sinner when I woke I was a saint
When I woke I found the canvas was no thicker than the paint

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When I woke I was a millionaire when I woke up I was broke
When I woke I drank that finest wine it only made me choke
When I woke I was a peasant when I woke I was a king
When I woke I ruled the devil but I couldn't talk to him

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">D/A/D/A
D/A/G/A
D/A/D/A
D/A/G/A

G/A/D/G
G/A/D/G
G/A/D/G
A/D</div>
