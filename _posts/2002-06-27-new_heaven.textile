In their shining ships they come from a country far beyond
Searching for a new Eden
With heaven on their minds, swords and bullets blessed
Destiny manifest

<div class="chorus">I'm not looking for a new heaven
I don't need a promised land
Has this earth been given us to conquer
Do we belong to the land</div>

Sifting through the smoking suburbs looking for some kind of trace
Oh the accidents of arson and grace
On the morning that we left we were gone without a trace
And the new world was shining from your face

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Running through the city sewers beneath the cloud of smog
There is writing on the wall
Armageddon's seeping through every single crack
The line of barges turning back

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/G/Am/E/Am
F/G/C

F/G/C/Am
F/G/C
F/G/B7/Am
C/G/C</div>
