I turn my back toward the wind  
As the winter blows on in  
And think of the summer sun  
How it warms the skin

And as the summer days pass slow  
How I wish for snow  
And the cold that cuts to bone  
To counter the sweat and sun

<div class="chorus">
	Southern exposure, northern sky<br/>
	Let me take whatever you bring<br/>
	The weather in my mind all of the time<br/>
	Let it be everything  
</div>

I've tried to balance the extremes  
On the fulcrum of my dreams  
Place the memories of spring  
Against the ice and wind

<div class="chorus">
	I will not dehydrate my soul<br/>
	Grow numb from cold<br/>
	But will live with what it is<br/>
	What I can hold
</div>

<div class="chorus">
	CHORUS
</div>

<div class="chords">
	G/D/Em<br/>
	C/D/G<br/>
	<br/>
	C/D/G/D/Em<br/>
	C/D/G<br/>
	C/D/G/D/Em<br/>
	C/D/G<br/>

	Em/D/G<br/>
	Em/G/D<br/>
	Em/D/G<br/>
