There ain't nothing on the TV, it's Friday night
And this old house is cold dark and quiet
I am sad and lonely, I am missing you
I've got hours to kill but I've got nothing to do

<div class="chorus">I don't want no golden apples 
I don't need half of the moon
I just want your time; give me an hour or two
I wanna get drunk, I wanna get drunk with you</div>

So what will it be girl; your place or mine
Whiskey, rum, tequila, bourbon, vodka, beer or wine
It comes in cans or bottles, has many different names
But drinking alone it just ain't the same

<div class="chorus">I don't want no golden apples 
I don't need half of the moon
It's very simple, here's what I want to do
I wanna get drunk, I wanna get drunk with you</div>

So if you're feeling lonesome if you're sad and blue
If this world has got you down, here's the thing to do
Call me up, I'm waiting, I will be there
I'll bring my own bottle and I'll even let you share

<div class="chorus">I don't want no golden apples 
I don't need half of the moon
If you're sad, I've got a cure
I wanna get drunk, I wanna get drunk with you</div>
