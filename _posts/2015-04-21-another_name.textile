	at Gadani Shipbreaking Yard
</div>

They've got you hanging on the scale, they're deciding who will pay
For what is left of you
And there is no place you call home, nowhere you can go
Even if you wanted to

You're washed up on the beach like a mountain to be reached
A weary pilgrim's end
The colors start to face while they're resting in your shade
Watching the ocean bend

<div class="chorus">
	In time you will remember
	Everything to which you swore
	Another name will be added
	To the ones that came before
</div>

You traveled the seas like some holy refugee
Bearing a secret fire
You went by many names, you were going places then
You were the object of desire
