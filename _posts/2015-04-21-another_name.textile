<div class="notes">
	at Gadani Shipbreaking Yard
</div>

They've got you hanging on the scale, they're deciding who will pay
For what is left of you
And there is no place you call home, nowhere you can go
Even if you wanted to

<div class="chorus">
	In time you will remember
	Everything to which you swore
	Another name will be added
	To the ones that came before
</div>

You're washed up on the beach like a mountain to be reached
Like some weary pilgrim's end
They've burned out both your eyes, cut you down to size until there's
Nothing on which you can depend

<div class="chorus">
	CHORUS
</div>

You traveled the seas from the west to the east
Bearing the fuel and the flame
You went by many names, you were going places then
And now you're up for salvage and for sale

<div class="chorus">
	CHORUS
</div>

<div class="chords">
	G/Em/C/D
	G/C/D

	C/D/G
	Em/D
	C/D/G/Em
	C/D/G
