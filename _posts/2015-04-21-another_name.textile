	at Gadani Shipbreaking Yard
</div>

They've got you hanging on the scale, they're deciding who will pay
For what is left of you
And there is no place you call home, nowhere you can go
Even if you wanted to

You're washed up on the beach like a mountain to be reached
A weary pilgrim's end
They've burned out both your eyes, cut you down to size
Nothing on which to depend

<div class="chorus">
	In time you will remember
	Everything to which you swore
	Another name will be added
	To the ones that came before
</div>

You traveled the seas from the west to the east
Bearing the spark to set the fire
You went by many names, you were going places then
You were an object of desire
