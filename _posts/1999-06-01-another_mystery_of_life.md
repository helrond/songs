You say that I should be out on my own now  
You say you want to be free  
You say that I forced you, you said you have no choice but to  
Be what you wanted to be

You say you don't want me, and then you say you love me  
Never told me to leave  
You say that you want me to be just who I want to  
As long it's really not me

I want to know just who it is that's talking  
The father, the man, or the heavy hand  
I want to know just what it is that's talking  
Your ego, your past, or your fear of being last

<div class="chorus">What are you saying  
Who are you playing  
What are you blaming on me</div>

I want you to slow down, I want to go down  
I have to get past these routines  
If anyone would know that I just can't stand them  
It would have to be you

<div class="chords">C/Am/G/F</div>
