Some folks they like whiskey others like their wine
Some they just drink Budweiser and others Natty Light
But when I slide up to the bar just one drink works for me
I say to the bartender I'll have whatever's cheap

<div class="chorus">Sometimes you need the President, sometimes you need the King
Sometimes you will just open up and let the Beast right in
Beggars can't be choosers, and nothing's ever free
Just say to the bartender you'll have whatever's cheap</div>

Some folks they like women with diamonds and pearls
And some they like their men dressed up like girls
Either way don't matter much just when we're out to eat
They say to the waiter I'll have whatever's cheap

<div class="chorus">Sometimes you'll eat with Senators, sometimes you'll eat with hogs
Sometimes you'll be so hungry you could eat your old hound dog
Beggars can't be choosers, and nothing's ever free
Just say to the waiter you'll have whatever's cheap</div>

Some folks go to church and some they stay at home
Some don't believe in God at all some call Satan their own
If you step up to the altar and he asks you what you need
Just say to the preacher I'll have whatever's cheap

<div class="chorus">Heaven is a Motel 6 and the sign says vacancy
Jesus gave out loaves and fishes down by the sea
The Staten Island Ferry is swinging down for me
And if you want salvation you can have it 'cause it's free</div>
