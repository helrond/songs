<div class="notes">for Azra</div>

And David sang of lions and lambs  
I think I know what he meant  
Rumi begged for signs, for stars and wine  
I think I've been where he went

<div class="chorus">
  Are you feeling the way I'm feeling now<br/>
  Are you seeing the things I'm seeing now
</div>

Ishmael swam and watched it all go down  
I've seen it happen too  
Shadrach danced and prayed in the smoke and flames  
I've walked miles in those shoes

<div class="chorus">
  CHORUS<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh my love what kind of storm<br/>
  Has washed me up on this shore<br/>
  Alone and afraid I conquered the waves<br/>
  And I've come straight to your door
</div>

The Prophet heard and then he spoke that word  
And I've read every one  
Buddha sat and dreamed underneath the tree  
I've been burned by that sun

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
