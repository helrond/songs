When you moved on the face of the waters, when you spoke into the void  
When the waters parted by sands of time, when silence echoed of noise  
It was then that you walked by the seashore casting out demons with a wave of your hand  
A stranger called out your name, he said you are the son of man  
And you cannot bind me, no I am not bound, I am Legion this world is my own  
You said, come my brother you were born to trouble and now I set you free  
The water is wide the water is troubled  
The water is fouled with the blood of 2 thousand  
All across this bay, the bay of pigs

When the scent of danger hangs in the air like the sweetest lilac flower  
When foreign interests bears its teeth, when blood lusts and fears  
It was then that you flew over water to incite a civil war  
And all along was failure planned or was it who you were fighting for  
And no one has chosen, and you did not choose your time of birth or place  
It is not between two countries that freedom takes its stake  
The water is wide the water is troubled  
The water is fouled with the blood of 2 thousand  
All across this bay, the bay of pigs

When I was drowning in rivers of sin and sinking in cold dark waters  
When I had walked into a place that I couldn't walk back out of  
It was then I saw him stretch out his hand to consecrate the water  
All the fish swam to the nets like it was the home that they'd always thought of  
And he said, to me leave your guns leave your butter; bread is for beggars and roses for lovers  
So come, come to the waters and live  
The water is wide the water is troubled  
The water is fouled with the blood of 2 thousand  
All across this bay, the bay of pigs
