Corners everywhere you look, but no dead-end streets  
Towers and monuments; an island of dreams  
Where the perfect day is always half a week away  
Distraction never leaves, tomorrow never stays

<div class="chorus">
  And all of the silences, all of the sounds<br/>
  All of the history going down<br/>
  With space to grow into mercy to move<br/>
  Too late for primetime and too early for the news
</div>

It's all about the angles, it's all about the light  
The tourists and their cameras, man, what's left to find  
Echoes of the emperors, the weight of history  
Vespas careening through these medieval streets

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Two globes, two palaces, two chambers and two births  
One for the heavens and one for the earth  
Motion perpetual, the span of all in one  
These are the threads from which a lifetime is spun

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Let us be bound for glory, you and I  
Minstrels and immigrants, three feet above the sky  
In love with silences, with sound, with everything  
I give it all to you my fellow citizens

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
