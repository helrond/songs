You talk about compromise  
Say it's not free  
You talk about acceptable prices  
Look at me

You talk about dictators  
How to foil their plans  
You talk about genocide  
Look at your hands

<div class="chorus">
  Meet me halfway to the land<br/>
  Where two rivers run through poisoned sand<br/>
  Meet me before time runs out the door<br/>
  And we are no more<br/>
  <br/>
  They look to our eyes for hope<br/>
  They look to our eyes<br/>
  They look to our eyes for hope<br/>
  We have none
</div>

You talk about our duty  
Protect the weak  
You talk about collateral damage  
Let them speak

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  Am/G<br/>
  <br/>
  Am/G<br/>
  Am/G<br/>
  Am/G<br/>
  F/G<br/>

  C/G/Am/G<br/>
  C/G/Am/G<br/>

  Am/G
