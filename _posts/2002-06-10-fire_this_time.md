They say parting is such sweet sorrow  
To say other would be a lie  
But the future that lies before us  
Is as dark as the path behind

They say it's better safe than sorry   
In matters such as these  
But I tasted the forbidden waters  
And suffered not to dream

<div class="chorus">
  And the fire that lies ahead<br/>
  Will burn brighter than the fire this time<br/>
  And the fear of your heart's desire<br/>
  Will turn your limbs to ice
</div>

They say it's only a shot away  
To break out of this hypnotic trance  
But to await the resurrection  
Sinner you've had your chance

They say that all will be left to memory  
The blood stains on the wall  
And the screams will fade into silence  
Like the smoke trail on the hill

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They have battered your crumbling towers  
To your weary heart laid siege  
But your womb it still is fertile  
And your thoughts they still run free

They say the kernel must be buried  
Or it cannot bear much fruit  
But how many must be buried  
Before we can bear the truth

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They say parting is such sweet sorrow  
More than the heart can hold  
And the future that lies before us  
Is burning in green and gold
