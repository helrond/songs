I see people I know almost everywhere
I have friends wherever I go
We have done for each other the best that we can
To keep out the dark and the cold

<div class="chorus">You
It could be you
You could be the one to defend
You
You could change my mind
You could be my new best friend</div>

I hear the voices of my friends
Everywhere that I go
Their clothing and their favorite songs
Become my own

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

My friends let me remember you
When I am alone
And dying be surrounded by
Faces I know

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
