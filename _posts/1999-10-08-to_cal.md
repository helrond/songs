You've seen him he stands there on the corner  
For hours holding his sign  
Nonviolence or nonexistence, Martin Luther King Jr.  
And people drive by like they're blind

The winter's fast fading to springtime's parading  
There's been too many to pass this one by  
If I've hope for the future it might be for you and your  
Trust in the yellowing sky

<div class="chorus">Fly your battle flag high  
Tell those little boys it's noble to die  
Dress them in uniform  
Their mothers will cry on a tidy corpse</div>

You've been as far down as the best high can get  
They had you doped right out of your head  
You say it took a blood clot in your brain but now it's what you've got  
That makes all the rest of us mad

It's your humble silence that gives me my sense  
That I let on much more than I know  
If you're an unarmed Christian in what position  
Does that leave this country's goal

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

It's the patterns of contradiction that might break our addiction  
To the gods of this heathen state  
It's a way of relation that might break this domination  
Before we throw up our hands and call it fate

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">D/A/G</div>
