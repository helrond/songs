Counting water towers from the back seat of a car  
Playing Take It to the Limit, it was 1984  
Colors and numbers, her ABCs  
But the things that she learned were more than any of these

<div class="chorus">
  Lessons learned in stories and songs<br/>
  Ways to take your mind off of what's going wrong<br/>
  How to begin all over again<br/>
  Who else could teach us all of these things
</div>

They would hang on her every word  
Of deserts and jungles and the animal world  
And while she taught them to count past ten  
They learned that failure is just giving in

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When she sang it was never alone  
Her voice blew darkness right out of this home  
Keeping the tempo, staying in key  
We learned how to live in harmony

How to live with mistakes you have made  
Ways to trick the monster out from under your bed  
How to behave like a human being  
These are the things that my mother taught me

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
