<div class="notes">Just have the chorus so far</div>

Here I am, it's Monday night
I've got this barstool and this glass
I'd like to let this head full of memories go
And give my heart another chance

<div class="chorus">I used to be on top of the world
I had it all; what I wanted to get
I used to be proud and courageous
All I have now are hangovers and disappearing paychecks</div>
