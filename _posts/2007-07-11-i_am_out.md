<div class="notes">with Alvin Arnold</div>

I am out to write a song for everybody  
For all who've been and all those yet to come  
For everyone who's given up completely  
I am out to sing a song for everyone

I am out to write a song for everybody  
Who's seen their share of hard times and dreams  
The rich, the poor, the losers and the winners  
And everybody else in between

<div class="chorus">
  A song for every person, in every single land<br />
  For all of those personalities<br />
  For every single city, and every single town<br />
  It's a song just for me
</div>

I am out to write a song for every season  
I am out to write a song for every day  
For the ghettos, the suburbs and the country  
For the places and names that never change

I am out to write a song for every country  
For every planet, every single sun  
And it will be like I believe, like I belong  
I am out to write this universe a song

<div class="chorus">
  A song for every person, in every single land<br />
  For all of those personalities<br />
  For every single city, and every single town<br />
  It's a song just for me
</div>
