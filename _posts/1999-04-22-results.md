I went out the other day with  
A man with a hand with molded clay  
Asked him if we've got a shot  
He smiled and said I write the plot

Cursed my fate and it loved the hate  
Broke my smile with a rubber file  
Cut my sight but the dark took flight  
And I saw what I've seen and I wish had never been

<div class="chorus">Just look at us now; one nation under the gun  
Just look at us now; we are Adam's only son  
Just look at us now; dead last in a race we won  
What have we become</div>

Saw a man on the edge of a broken glass  
With his face in a knot his eyes in a bind and his heart in the past  
Jump and live he'll jump and die  
Maybe he won't but just as soon try

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
Em/D  

Em/C/G/D</div>
