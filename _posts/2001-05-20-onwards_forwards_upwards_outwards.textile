The market's got the bulls running again and
I'm too tired to run
I turn around to face the dust and the hooves
Looking down the barrel of a gun

Mortgage payments credit card debts
I've looked into their eyes
Phone bills hone your skills and simon says
Kiss my ass goodbye

<div class="chorus">Onwards forwards upwards outwards I'll take the highway over your way
If I drive this far tonight you'll never find me
Buy sell trade and go to hell don't pass go just go to jail
If I lose myself tonight you'll never find me</div>

They say always go up
Have you ever looked down from the top
When the elevator's stuck
Do you take the stairs and when do you stop

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Can't push me off can't pull me back
At least this one thing is gonna be mine
Standing fifty stories up
The wind is blowing saying this could be the time

If I jump I'm not gonna fall
The chains and greedy paper ghosts blow away
If I jump I'm not gonna scream
Tomorrow the headline's gonna say

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
