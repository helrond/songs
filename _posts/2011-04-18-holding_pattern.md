I got my left hand down and I'm waiting for that call  
I am tuned to the static, I am waiting for that call  
Maintaining altitude until I run out of fuel  
I can only wait on that call

<div class="chorus">
And he says hold on  
Just a little longer son  
We'll get you safely down, just take another turn around  
There is a right way for things to be done</div>

I've grown tired as hell waiting for that call  
But I can't sleep because I'm waiting for that call  
My stomach's rumbling, but I can't eat a thing  
All I can do is wait on that call

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I've got a buzzing mind and I'm waiting for that call  
And a twitching eye because I'm waiting for that call  
Could be headed east or west, the sun don't rise and it never sets  
Take another swing around and wait on that call

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
C/F/C  
F/E  
F/C/Am  
F/G  

Am/C  
Am/G  
Am/C/Am  
F/G</div>
