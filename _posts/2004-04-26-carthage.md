The fields near the shore have been turned by the harrow the women are baking bread for tomorrow  
Ashes of corpses and ashes of houses and blood on the land  
Columns of smoke rise as emblems of despair the loudspeaker sputters out a final call to prayer  
Broken horizons and hobbling horses and blood on the sand

<div class="chorus">Who am I to call myself son of the stars  
Who am I to deny the claims of my heart  
Who am I to call Carthage my own</div>

The house holds its ruin within its own walls the foundation stones are the seeds of downfall  
Salt in the wounds salt in the furrows the bend of the knees  
The sons burning Carthage are sons born of Priam and daughters of Cain are the sisters of Zion  
Elephants coming down out of the mountains and fear on the breeze

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Here in this city where the talk shows are tragic where staying alive feels like studying magic  
Where I am still looking for Truth in the circus and lies in the Times  
Wander these streets â€˜til the desert has made me numb ride on these rails like a disciple sick for home  
Write down the memories of your wooden soldiers and write down your crimes

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

If you were Queen Dido and I was Aeneas how could I how would I have left this heavenly bliss  
Does that make me the slave of passion or king of my fate  
If I was destined for the founding of empire how could I conquer the walls of desire  
Would I be captive to gods in the heavens or gods of my mind

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
Em/G/C/Am  
Em/G/C/D  

Em/D/G/D</div>
