I am waiting in the doorway with my raincoat on  
For you to spill your heart all over me  
She said to watch I don't fall into enemy hands  
But I am occupied territory  
And our armies are massing in foreign lands  
To strike fear in their hearts and houses  
She said this once was my homeland but now it has been sold  
Subdivided into two acre parcels

All the animals that work on the graveyard shift  
Laugh in the face of my conviction  
They say I can never cure my advanced disease  
But I am undaunted in my mission  
So I've tried to guide my boat toward celestial shores  
Where still waters run deep  
But fair weather and fair winds are not a sailor's life  
And courage not a virtue given cheap

The sad eyed sandman on the banks of the Danube  
Whispers in my ear it's just for fun  
Meanwhile I am drifting towards the water's edge  
Where the current is running deep and strong  
And Charles DeGaulle is laughing like he's back in 1940  
And he knows something you do not  
She said I am a liar she said I am a thief  
She said I am all I say I'm not

But now I've offered up my soul to the queen of distraction  
She knows what to make of it  
She said I am the one with the devastating touch  
Everything I touch turns to shit  
You crept in with the draft on a cold winter's night  
This morning I shook with a fever  
I said Lord where've you been I've been missing you so long  
She said it's only one night and you were dreaming

I am standing in the doorway with my raincoat on  
And you will spill your heart all over me  
She said to watch I don't fall into enemy hands  
But I am occupied territory
