Burn my eyes with a holy fire let me see all things anew  
Burn my eyes with a holy fire let me learn to love the truth  
Though I walk through storms and shadows I shall not be moved  
Burn my eyes with a holy fire let me see all things renewed

Wash my hands with holy water let them be at work always  
Wash my hands with holy water let them never long to stray  
To my poor, my friends, my neighbors, enemies extend  
Wash my hands with holy water let their work be yours always

Set my feet on paths of glory let them walk on holy ground  
Set my feet on paths of glory let them be upward bound  
Let them take me to the place where all will be revealed  
Set my feet on paths of glory let this all be holy ground

Burn my tongue with coals of fire let me speak of distant shores  
Burn my tongue with coals of fire let my words always be yours  
In the wideness of your presence learn to keep my peace  
Burn my tongue with coals of fire  bring me safely ashore

Break my heart with holy wisdom let me learn to love again  
Break my heart with holy wisdom let me on your strength depend  
And the power past all knowing clothed in sacrifice  
Break my heart with holy wisdom let me long for you again
