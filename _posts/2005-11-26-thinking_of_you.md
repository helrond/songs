The fridge buzzes, the rocking chair groans  
Kettle has boiled dry as a bone  
Lists and deadlines should be running through my mind  
But I sit here thinking of you

I've got the great American novel in my head  
A lifetime of books to be read  
There's a song in the headlines screaming to be born  
And I sit here thinking of you

There are dishes to be washed and bills to pay  
There's a world to be saved  
But you can find me here doing what I do best  
Sitting and thinking of you
