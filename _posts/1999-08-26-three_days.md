When I woke up it was raining  
I heard the sound of a wet street outside  
When I woke up I felt clean again  
Felt good enough to take on three days at a time

Over on Park Street someone just died  
Shot in the head on a Saturday night  
The cops chased some kid around  
No one's any wiser about it now

The pews are empty except for a few  
And I want to be wrong about you  
You want protection and I understand  
But how can you save what you don't command

Could you hear the shots - at night  
Would you walk down that street - alone  
How do you know when to get out  
What do you do when a deal goes down

When I fell asleep it was raining  
Rain streaked the window, cars drove by  
Tell me, do you feel clean now  
Are you living so that others can die
