When I die I want it to be like this facing the sun
I was not born to fade away turn tail and run
Though my life is over I will have just begun
When I die I want it to be like this facing the dawn

When I die I want it to be like this braving the rain
Forged shackles cannot hold me down nor ball and chain
What I have done to deserve this I dare not explain
When I die I want it to be like this not fearing pain

When I die I want it to be like this chasing the storm
I would not burn this world to ash if it could be transformed
Thought I have reaped the whirlwind's wrath clench not my palm 
When I die I want it to be like this embracing calm

Take me and wash me in this flood of justice rolling down
Let it rock me let it roll me let it purify my soul
The song of great awakening lifted by wind and fire
Borne on the wings of a homeward flow
And the laughter, the laughter of a child
