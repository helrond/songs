I have said you are all that I could ask for  
I have said that you are all I can see  
But that will not stop me expecting an angel  
And the dreams I have yet to dream

<div class="chorus">When I leave my legs will do the walking  
The downturn will be my economy's  
When I leave I will have finished talking  
And you will be watching me  
Walk away</div>

I have said you are all that I could ask for  
I have said that you are all I can see  
And though I cannot explain why I am not a liar  
I've seen the distance to eternity

<div class="chorus">When I leave my legs will do the walking  
The downturn will be my economy's  
When I leave I will have finished talking  
And you will be watching me  
Walk away</div>
