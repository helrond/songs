Run through the streets of Chinatown
To get on the bus named after a sign
With some luck all of the light
Won't be gone by the time you arrive

If you've got friends in another town
Try to get there fast as you can
And you've got ____ and decisions to make
But the results are out of your hands

<div class="chorus">And you know what it's going to take
	But still you hope that fortune and luck will go your way
	And you hope for space and you hope for speed
	Try to keep your expectations from becoming your need
</div>

So you do the best that you can
Look for ways to beat the odds, improve your chances, pass the time
But you know by the time you arrive
Everybody will be already drunk and high

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
