Run through the streets of Chinatown
Get on a bus named after a sign
With some luck all of the light
Won't be gone by the time you arrive

So you've got friends in some other town
Make it there fast as you can
You've got a seat and you've got plans
But the results are out of your hands

<div class="chorus">And you know what it's going to take
	But still you hope that fortune and luck will go your way
	And you hope for space and you hope for speed
	Keep your expectations from becoming your need
</div>

So you do the best you can
Look for ways to beat the odds, improve your chances, pass the time
But you know by the time you arrive
Everyone will be drunk and already high

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
