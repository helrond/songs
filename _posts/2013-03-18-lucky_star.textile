Get on the bus named after a sign
Crawl through the streets of Chinatown

By the time you get there (arrive)
Everybody will be already drunk and high

<div class="chorus">And you know what it's going to take
	But still you hope that fortune and luck will go your way
	And you try to keep your hopes from getting too high
	And you try to keep moving to keep covering the miles
</div>

Make the best of things
hope for a lucky break
balance hope and expectation
