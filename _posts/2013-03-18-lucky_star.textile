Run through the streets of Chinatown
To get on the bus named after a sign
With some luck all of the light
Won't be gone by the time you arrive

Try to get there as fast as you can
But the details are out of your hands


Get your ticket signed and stand in line

Look for advantage and wait in line

Ways to beat the odds, raise your chances, pass the time

Separate luck and plans
What is in and out of your hands

By the time you get there (arrive)
Everybody will be already drunk and high

<div class="chorus">And you know what it's going to take
	But still you hope that fortune and luck will go your way
	And you hope for space and you hope for speed
	Try to keep your expectations from becoming your need
</div>

Make the best of things
hope for a lucky break
balance hope and expectation
