Have you heard about the red dirt miners  
Have you heard about the heavy load  
Have you heard about the price they paid  
And the 12 wheeled trucks they drove
<div class="chorus>
Bringing it down<br/>
Bringing it down<br/>
Bringing it all back down<br/>
</div>  

Have you heard about the things they whispered  
As they worked those open pits  
And as the dust storms spun and rattled  
How they held onto their wits  
<div class="chorus>
Bringing it down<br/>
Bringing it down<br/>
Bringing it all back down<br/>
</div>  

Have you heard how they broke that union  
Have you heard how they cut them down  
How the ships flew by their hands  
How their blood ran into the ground
<div class="chorus>
Bringing it down<br/>
Bringing it down<br/>
Bringing it all back down<br/>
</div>

Have you heard about the red dirt miners  
Have you heard about the heavy load  
Have you learned about the tracks they left  
In the planet's dust and snow
<div class="chorus>
Bringing it down<br/>
Bringing it down<br/>
Bringing it all back down<br/>
</div>

  <div class="chords">
