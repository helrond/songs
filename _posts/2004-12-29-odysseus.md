I'm not a man who's been so far away that I've lost all allegiance to home  
I'm not a man who's had so many names that I have forgotten my own  
I am the immigrant I am the abdicant I am the prodigal son  
I am the man of many ways but I still know the path to my home

I'm not a man who's been so far from land that I've fallen in love with the sea  
I'm not a man who's seen so many wonders I'm blind to the marvel of peace  
I am the song and I am the singer I am the minor key  
I am a man who has lived on these waters but I must be leaving the sea

<div class="chorus">
  Bring me my gold my arrow my bow<br/>
  A star to steer me true<br/>
  This is my story my honor my glory<br/>
  Now I am going home
</div>

I'm not a man who's been so many people that I've lost a claim to my soul  
I'm not a man who's been so long a stranger that my feet do not turn toward home  
I am the captain I am the anchor I am the billowing sail  
I am the man of many faces but I've not forgotten my soul
