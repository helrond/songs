Look around this mountainside  
Look where the red tail flies  
On the rooftops far below  
See the first signs of snow

Wish I had a home on high  
Wish I was the burning sky  
Wish I was the falling rain  
Wish I had no other name

When I first came to this place  
I was looking for your face  
If I pass this way again  
I will think of you my friend

When the creeks have all run dry  
Then you'll see her pass on by  
In this place her wisdom speak  
Where the waters cannot reach

Look around this mountainside  
Let your thoughts grow free and wild  
Look around where you belong  
Feel the harmony, the song
