My baby wishes she was in London  
Her friends want to move to New York  
My sister lives in San Francisco  
But her heart is still in El Salvador

<div class="chorus">Here is here  
And now and then  
You've been wondering where you've been</div>

My brother wants to get away from Canton  
He doesn't care for France or Italy  
My friends who live out in the country  
Know there is somewhere they would rather be

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I want to be in ancient Athens  
Or Moscow in 1963  
I want to wear dark sunglasses  
And drive down the Champs Elysees

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/C  
D/G  
G/Am  
D/G  

C/D  
G/Em  
C/D/G/D/G</div>
