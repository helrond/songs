My baby wishes she was in London  
Her friends want to move to New York  
My sister lives in San Francisco  
But her heart is still in El Salvador

<div class="chorus">
  Here is here<br />
  And now and then<br />
  You've been wondering where you've been
</div>

My brother wants to get away from Canton  
He doesn't care for France or Italy  
My friends who live out in the country  
Know there is somewhere they would rather be

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I want to be in ancient Athens  
Or Moscow in 1963  
I want to wear dark sunglasses  
And drive down the Champs Elysees

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
