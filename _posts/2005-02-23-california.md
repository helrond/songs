It's skin and bones but it kicks like a mule and  
It'll carry my pack my rifle my boots  
Left on my dime my senses behind  
Digging for dreams in Jackson mine

<div class="chorus">California bound  
Futures there to be found  
Go west young man there's gold in the hills  
Of California</div>

It's the Central Pacific 508  
And it'll take me due west to San Jose  
Over Chinese bones John Henry's steel  
An open door and a turn of the wheel

<div class="chorus">California bound  
Futures there to be found  
I don't believe from here the birds fly south in winter  
From California</div>

It's got a shake and a rattle but it's still gonna roll  
And half a tank will get me to Sacramento  
From there it's all downhill until I hit the sea  
The Hollywood hills the silver screen

<div class="chorus">California bound  
Futures there to be found  
I'll take the endless miles the wind in my hair  
To California</div>

I've got a voice and I know it ain't mine  
I've got a roving eye and a distracted mind  
I'm a leaky boat a plane without wings  
I'm not doing too bad with just paper and string

<div class="chorus">California bound  
Futures there to be found  
I'm just like anyone I want what is forbidden  
California  
I'm just like anyone I want to be forgiven  
California</div>
