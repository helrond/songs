This train is no good for anyone
This train is no good for anyone
It will run you down and wreck your mind, take all your money and your time
This train is no good for anyone

I heard that lonesome train whistle blow
Yes I heard that long and lonesome whistle blow
I was sitting by the riverside thinking up a way to die
When I heard that lonesome train whistle blow

The engineer he spoke to me by name
That engineer he called me by my name
Said get up son and follow me, leave behind your dignity
That engineer he spoke my name

Look what these rails done to me
Honey, look what these rails done to me
Robbed me of my will to live, everything that I could give
Look what these steel rails done to me

I hear her now she's coming down the line
Yes I hear her now a-coming down the line
She's straining all her steel and nerve, leaning hard into that curve
I hear that train a-coming down the line

This train is no good for anyone
This train is no good for anyone
It will run you down and wreck your mind, take all your money and your time
This train is no good for anyone
