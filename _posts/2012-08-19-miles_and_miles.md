The Romans walked a thousand paces  
Al-Farghani laid his stakes in the sand  
And while we've measured distance on land, air and water  
We've known space between a heart and a hand

<div class="chorus">
  And there are miles and miles between us<br/>
  But no distance at all<br/>
  And there are mile and miles separating you and I<br/>
  But nothing comes between us at all
</div>

units of measure  
pieces of paper between here and the moon  
geography  
time  
borders

<div class="chords">
  Am/G/Am<br/>
  Am/G/Am<br/>
  Am/G/C/F<br/>
  Am/G/Am<br/>
  <br/>
  C/G/Am<br/>
  C/G/Am<br/>
  C/G/F/Am<br/>
  Am/G/Am
</div>
