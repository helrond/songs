On those hot summer nights years ago  
We played flashlight hide and go seek  
Turned ourselves into monsters  
And ran from the shadow behind the trees

The shadows grew up with me  
Hid under my bed, hung from the walls  
Hid in my books got on the bus with me  
And if i let them, chased me down the halls

You tell me I'm psycho, tell me I'm crazy  
These shadows are things no one can see  
I say you're the one that is crazy  
There's on your shoulder talking to me

<div class="chorus">Tonight -- I ask what is sight  
What I see -- can't just be me  
Tonight I -- need a bright light  
So I know -- which are the shadows</div>

You find them everywhere you'd expect  
A dumpster, a prison, a whorehouse, a bar  
Sometimes you find them in the bright lights  
Yesterday i saw one at the altar

<div class="chorus">Tonight -- I ask what is sight  
What I see -- can't just be me  
Tonight I -- need a bright light  
So I know -- which are the shadows</div>

<div class="chords">
