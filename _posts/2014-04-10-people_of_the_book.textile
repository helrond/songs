Moses carved the law into stone tablets
And then he came down off the mountain and broke it in the sand
People do you know how they rose from Egypt
Wandered for forty years without a homeland

<div class="chorus">When you read what you believe
And you open to the page you had to see
When you know before you look
When you find it in the book</div>

He lost his faith in forty thousand
Singing a hymn to Commandante Carlos in unison

There is more than unites us than divides
We are people of the book
