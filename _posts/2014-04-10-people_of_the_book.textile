Moses carved the law into stone tablets
And then he came down off the mountain and broke it in the sand
People do you know how they rose from Egypt
Wandered for forty years without a homeland

<div class="chorus">When you read what you believe
And you open to the page you had to see
When you know before you look
When you find it in the book</div>

Zoroaster went to the river
When he came up out the water he was met by a divine spark
Wrote it down in seventeen songs
Said you've got to choose the light or you'll be chosen by the dark

Gabriel came to Muhammad
And he passed through seven heavens in a single night
His pen it wrote down every word as it was heard
When he set the Black Stone in the Kaaba he kept the peace between the tribes

Now I hear them talking about holy water
Who's gonna end up on the altar and how it's going to look
There is more that unites than divides us
There are prophets everywhere you look, oh people of the book
