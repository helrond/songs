The road up north to a New Jerusalem
Angels scream for the blood of men
Rocks have ears, stones have eyes
Sun in eyes in falling skies

He was thirsty he had fallen among thieves
Sweat on his face, dirt on his knees
And then the red Chevy comes
The Good Samaritan pulls out a gun

<div class="chorus">It used to be you were just ignored
Now you're shot at and destroyed</div>

Twenty-two years shot, bleeding to death
Don't dream for more than second best
The man who shot him pulls over, stops
"It's just a trespassing Mexican, call the cops"

<div class="chorus">It used to be you were just ignored
Now you're shot at and destroyed

Hey, hey everybody run
The Good Samaritan's got a gun
Hey, hey what's the score
Who's winning the Good Samaritan War</div>

South of the Border, American investments
Work ten hours a day for fifty cents
Up north, the Good American
Thinks he's the Good Samaritan

<div class="chorus">Don't look at me like that, it's not my fault
At least now, they have a job

CHORUS</div>

Call the name of war, call slavery
The horsemen ride again against the tree
Heaven rains down blood and fire
Smoke curls from crumbling empires
