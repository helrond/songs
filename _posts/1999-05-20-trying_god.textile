I still remember the day they took her innocence
I still remember the pain of endurance
The day was dark, night darker yet
Stars watching above us never set

We were here waiting for a savior
Instead of him you sent a killer
I can remember I'm still dreaming of 
He said forgive me it was love

<div class="chorus">Night is screaming and the screams become the stars
That shine down upon our bloodied scars
Night is screaming through a darkened glass
Holding up back against our past</div>

There are no Christians in this Christian land
There are no wounds on these Christian hands
There is no white in these painted lies
There are no ears to hear their cries

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

There is always one to escape
There is always one to call it a miracle
There is always one to scream out silently
There is always one to escape

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">E/G#m/A/B</div>
