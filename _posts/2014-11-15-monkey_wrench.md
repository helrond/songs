Now I'm trying to come clean, to cross the distance in between  
Trying to hear the substance of your words  
But you keep talking about the past, how things never last  
There's always something else you would prefer

You're an army of one, you've got tanks and you've got guns  
And you're bound to shoot down everything that moves  
You've got ammunition, you know it can't be done  
Things will only get worse and not improve

<div class="chorus">Let's not blame it on the time before  
Let's not wrack our brains for one more  
Remote possiblity or the wildest thing we could conceive  
Let's not talk about the monkey wrench no more</div>

You go tearing buildings down, you make it hard to get around  
In between the rubble and the noise  
And everything looks like a nail to the hammer of your brain  
Nothing could ever be enjoyed

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/C/G  
G/D  
G/C/G  
G/D/G  

G/D/C/C/D  
G/D/C/C/D  
G/D/Em/C  
G/D/G/C/G</div>
