You can run it back at half speed or play it double time  
Flip it upside down and backwards, sync it up and make it rhyme  
But no matter how you sell it or which way you make it spin  
You'll be going out the same way you came in

<div class="chorus">There's no mistaking the direction  
The heading or the speed  
The weight of what is gone or what's to be  
It doesn't take a magician  
Or a prophet to see  
The national velocity</div>

You can dress it up in leather, top it off with a Stetson hat  
Get it all decked out uniform, epaulets and spats  
But whatever cut or color you decide to put it in  
It's still got that same ugly skin

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Well you can plaster it over so it looks like it's brand new  
Cover up the dirt with an attractive shade of blue  
But you've got to rebuild it, there's nothing else to do  
The whole thing is rotten through and through

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
