She was born on the banks of the Tennessee  
She was raised by the TVA  
And she stole her first kiss on the levee bridge  
The night they took him away

He was born and bred on Buzzards Bay  
As Yankee as they come  
But when he made it down to Birmingham  
He finally felt at home

<div class="chorus">
  North and South<br />
  Breathe it in, let it out<br />
  North and South<br />
  I could never leave you now
</div>

He was always out of rhythm  
With those big city ways  
And when the snow was falling down  
He dreamt of warmer days

They called her Yanqui in San Salvador  
Her family thought her strange  
And anyway that she behaved  
Her voice gave her away

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You took the highway, you headed my way  
You drove through the night  
And I was home free, I had your country  
Locked in my sights

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
