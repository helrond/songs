water freezes this july
burning kisses fall from the sky
humanity sinks out of sight
the sun's caresses give way to night

in africa the desert's frozen
artic water boils to the yellow skies
noah's ark is slowly sinking
this world we've blown is lost to our eyes

last night I heard the screaming 
went outside to watch them fall from the sky
tonight I hear the screaming
of a world that's not quite ready to die

it's because we loved our children
it's because we had to keep up with someone else
it's because we need inventory
this is our final love song for the earth

<div class="chorus">BRIDGE:
this ain't no hippie thing
love your mother, hug a tree
if there's nothing to wake up to tomorrow
it's gonna be a hell of a long sleep</div>

it's because we loved our children
it's because we had to keep up with someone else
it's because we need inventory
this is our final love song for the earth
