He's sitting and talking of other days  
Better and worse in their own special ways  
He's weaving me stories and I'm woven in too  
And we're turning back the pages we drew

We were a man-eating group of first-born kids  
No one could survive us, but somehow he did  
And he turned us all over and shook out our meanness  
Told us just where we were, and we've never been less

<div class="chorus">I say you are my Northern Star</div>

We're scattered all over the face of the globe  
But all of us carry the things that we know  
That winning sometimes means giving ground  
And if you can swim you still can drown

<div class="chorus">I say you are my Northern Star</div>

He sighs and sits back, the story's been told  
And I want to be just as wise when I'm old  
With the bad came the good, with the good came the bad  
But he gave us the best, show us all that we had

<div class="chorus">
  I say you are my Northern Star<br/>
  My favorite scar, the best without bar<br/>
  My Northern Star
</div>
