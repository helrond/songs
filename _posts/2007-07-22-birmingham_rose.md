She was born the youngest of seven  
In a three-room bungalow  
Wrestling hurricanes and rattlers  
With a rifle and a hoe

The boys lined up at county fairs  
To swing her do-si-do  
And with empty pockets, worn out shoes  
They crawled off alone

<div class="chorus">
  None could outsmart or claim her heart<br />
  Or follow the way she goes<br />
  None is as tender, none is as fierce<br />
  As my Birmingham Rose
</div>

Grew corn and beans and babies  
Out of that rocky ground  
And she stood on the porch with that shotgun on her hip  
When the taxman came around

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Lost her grandfather to Sherman  
And a grandson to Vietnam  
She could pick a bale every day  
There was iron in those hands

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They say she's lived forever  
They say she'll never die  
As long as trees grow from these hills  
And rain falls from the sky

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
