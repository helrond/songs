Walking on the side on my way down the road  
To heaven  
Stuck on a face hanging out of a window  
Skeptical grin

Said son you've got a good heart  
But a weak head  
All those crazy dictators will kill us  
If we're not prepared

<div class="chorus">What is it about genocide  
What about the bigger lies  
What is it about suicide  
That's worth the price</div>

The cradle of civilization cracked  
Babylon's fallen  
All the dictators and government leaders  
Can't fix it again

<div class="chorus">
What you say is going to last  
What you see is not the past  
What you hear is not the last  
Of this song

Wave your flag and march around  
Waive your right to higher ground  
What about your salvation   
It's not free</div>
