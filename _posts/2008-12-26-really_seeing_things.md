I climbed to the top of St. Peter's on a dark and crowded stair  
And I stood and watched the city gasping for air  
I stumbled down a mineshaft in a medieval town  
Holding to my lantern like a sailor going down

<div class="chorus">Now I'm really seeing things  
Now I'm really seeing things</div>

Crossing California in the heart of Chinatown  
Saw written on a tower "son, observe the time"  
And I passed by the Sir Francis and Huey Newton's home  
On streets where ghosts of sailors and Ferlinghetti roam

<div class="chorus">Now I'm really seeing things  
Now I'm really seeing things</div>

And saw an Artic Tern flying pole to pole  
Songs and cats developesd with some patience and care  
At every border crossing I had nothing to declare

<div class="chorus">Now I'm really seeing things  
Now I'm really seeing things</div>
<div class="chords">C/F/C
