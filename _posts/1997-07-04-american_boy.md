He was a good kid, loved America,  
Strawberry Pop-tarts, apple pie.  
Baseball on summer afternoons,  
Good American boy.

He was a good soldier, saved another's life,  
Played by the rules, never said no.  
Never mind what he did, he obeyed orders  
Good American boy.

<div class="chorus">American boy comes home to America,  
War does something to everyone.  
American boy loves his America,  
Oh little boy, where have you gone?</div>

April 15, nineteen hundred and ninety five  
A blast breaks the Oklahoma sky  
America watches in horror and amazement  
Somebody has to die.

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

He's a monster, cold, unhuman, dead  
Of another species, what's in his head  
Stony-eyed, emotionless, killer of children's joys  
Good American boy

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Fry him, fry him, fry him, fry him, he's the one  
Forget John Doe, government implication  
Ax man, governmental toy  
Good American boy

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Verse: G/Em/Am/D  
Chorus: G/D/Am/C/D</div>
