There's a lot of people talking about what kind of mess we're in  
And people offering advice for which nobody asked them  
And people building dams, putting in wells and pumps  
But when the flood comes, the water's going to run where it wants  

<div class="chorus">
  When the flood comes down, you better find a boat<br/>
  When the flood comes down, something that floats<br/>
  When the flood comes down
</div>

There's talk about public health and decency  
Respect for law and order and property  
People picking through the trash, building levees out of junk  
But when the flood comes, the water's going to cover what it wants

<div class="chorus">
  When the flood comes down, you better hold that fort<br/>
  When the flood comes down, shut down that port<br/>
  When the flood comes down
</div>

Some people live on nothing, some people got everything  
Some people pay attention, some people never learn a thing  
Some people claim to be something they are not  
But when the flood comes, the water's going to drown who it wants

<div class="chorus">
  When the flood comes down, you cannot hide<br/>
  When the flood comes down, from a rising tide<br/>
  When the flood comes down<br/>
  When the flood comes down, it will be washed away<br/>
  When the flood comes down, on that day<br/>
  When the flood comes down
</div>

  G/D/G<br/>
