Got me a gun and a fake tattoo
A flight suit and a Bible too
Got me a gun and a fake tattoo
I'm a Soldier of the Lord

I shoot first and I shoot to kill
I defend God's Holy Will
I shoot first and I shoot to kill
I'm a Soldier of the Lord

Got me a mandate to use force
Got me one that's bigger than yours
Got me a mandate to use force
I'm a Soldier of the Lord

I come in hard I come in strong
I come in low out of the rising sun
I come in hard I come in strong
I'm a Soldier of the Lord

Got me an army got me a war
Got me political capital
Got me an army got me a war
I'm a Soldier of the Lord
