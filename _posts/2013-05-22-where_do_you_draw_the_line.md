<div class="chorus">Where do you draw the line  
In the bonds of blood or the arms of crime  
Where do you draw the line  
On the cross, the crescent or the hills of time</div>

bottom line

You pick them up from your father  
You learn them in your school  
You catch them in churches and hospitals  
And they run you around like a fool

I'm trying to forget all of mine

Let me be the last to tell you  
That you can carry everything  
But let noone else set the limits  
To your circles of affection

G/Em/G
