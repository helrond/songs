Five seconds after I walk out the door
I miss you
Right after I hang up the phone
I miss you
All the way on that late night bus
Taking me away from us
When I remember what I planned to say
I miss you

When I've had more than enough to drink
I miss you
When I am too tired to even think
I miss you


When skies are cloudy and its pouring rain
When I am singing under sunny skies
When I'm all alone by myself at night
When I'm packed in the bus on a rainy day
