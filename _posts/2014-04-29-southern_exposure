I turn my back toward the wind
As the winter blows on in
And think of the summer sun
How it warms the skin

And as the summer days pass slow
How I wish for snow

<div class="chorus">
Southern exposure, northern sky
Let me take whatever you bring
The weather in my mind all of the time
Let it be everything
</div>
