I cannot know the weight of this world
I've got nothing to tell you but all the wrong words
I cannot know the weight, the weight of this world
I am helpless, just like you

I cannot know the weight of these years
I cannot bind the accuser, discredit these fears
And under the weight, the weight of these years
I am broken, just like you

I cannot know the weight of this pull
The places you're pushed all beyond your control
In gravity's power, oblivion's hold
I am lonely, just like you

I cannot know the weight of this world
The best I can do are these simple words
That hanging there that afternoon
He was helpless, just like you
