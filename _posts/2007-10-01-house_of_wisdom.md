When the barricades were silent and the royal guards lay dead  
When Marie Antoinette lost her head  
They took up the king's library  
And wrote down the books on aces and threes

<div class="chorus">
  This was a house of wisdom<br />
  This was a house of perfection<br />
  This was a house of wisdom<br />
  Now it's gone
</div>

Its holdings built on theft and toil  
The world's wisdom gathered within its walls  
All those scrolls of authority  
Lost to fires and changing regimes

It was said that the Catholics were to blame  
As the General Letter Office went up in flames  
The royal court cowered, the Lord Mayor fled  
The people left homeless, their letters unsent

The Tigris ran black; the city lay waste  
The ruler was trampled, his statues defaced  
Pages bled as palaces burned  
The wisdom of centuries was unlearned

<div class="chords">
