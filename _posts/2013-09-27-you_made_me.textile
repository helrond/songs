I've been trying to get over you
But you've got a way of keeping a hold
Over me and my fears
Are nothing to you but diamonds and gold

I've been trying to live my own life
But you reel me in as you're turning your back
To me and the dark side of you
Is something I could not possibly lack

<div class="chorus">You made the best of me bring me down low
You made me feel I was all on my own
Made me a liar and broke my health
You made me do it all to myself</div>

Made me choose between my friends and you
Dressed up as responsibility

Promised formulas and rewards
Talked of investment and traded in fraud

Made me care about things that don't matter and ignore the things that count

You made me think it was me but really it was you

When things fall apart, you can see the pieces
