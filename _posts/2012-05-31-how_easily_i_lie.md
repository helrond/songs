It came out in an avalanche of words  
And when they stopped, I wondered what I'd heard  
But I tried to give her one more chance  
To explain something that makes no sense

<div class="chorus">
  When you ask me how she's doing<br/>
  And if everything's alright<br/>
  When you ask me how I'm doing<br/>
  I'm surprised how easily I lie
</div>

And the sink in the kitchen drips  
The roof has leaks I've got no desire to fix  
I have given up the yard to weeds  
And offered up my heart to a thief

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  Am/F/C<br/>
  Am/F/C<br/>
  Am/F/G<br/>
  Am/F/G<br/>
  <br/>
  F/C/F/G<br/>
  Am/C/G<br/>
  F/C/F/G<br/>
  Am/G/C
</div>
