It came out in an avalanche of words  
And when they stopped, I wondered what I'd heard  
But I tried to give her one more chance  
To explain something that makes no sense

<div class="chorus">When you ask me how she's doing  
    And if everything's alright  
    When you ask me how I'm doing  
    I'm surprised how easily I lie</div>

And the sink in the kitchen drips  
The roof has leaks I've got no desire to fix  
I have given up the yard to weeds  
And offered up my heart to a thief

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
Am/F/C  
Am/F/C  
Am/F/G  
Am/F/G  

F/C/F/G  
Am/C/G  
F/C/F/G  
Am/G/C</div>
