You passed it on like some disease  
What it's become you can't believe  
How it looks and what was said  
The thoughts to which that led

<div class="chorus">
  You let it, you let it out<br/>
  Look where it's gone<br/>
  You let it, you let it out<br/>
  Look what it's done
</div>

You wear it out all over town  
A secret that's been passed around  
Until it's worn through every seam  
Until it's obvious and mean

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chorus">
  All the way down the valley<br/>
  They shouted out your name<br/>
  But you had no conviction<br/>
  And you had no shame
</div>

You put it out on every line  
You let it ring and let it ride  
Over the wires to your defense  
In search of blood and consequence

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
