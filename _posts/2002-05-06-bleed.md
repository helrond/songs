<div class="notes">"Blood will have blood" - Shakespeare, Macbeth</div>

It's a beautiful day in December and the war is coming home  
Across the fields where shepherds sleep tanks of the armies roam  
Sees the blood in the toilet bowl thinks of her late addition  
The way her body is bound to the moon in constant capitulation  

<div class="chorus">
  You tell me<br/>
  Is it your heart or down below<br/>
  For your country or for your soul<br/>
  That you bleed
</div>

The agents of fear and disorder crawl the salty brine  
Drink from the wells of beauty and health drink to the prophetic sign  
Marines have landed on the shores of the bay cut off escape over land  
They've already taken the radio station armed to the teeth to a man  

<div class="chorus">CHORUS  

I heard you say  
All that rises must submerge  
I heard you say  
Red sky at morn does sailors warn  
I heard you say  
Whatever goes around  
Must come  
Must come around</div>

This time when they lock you up for your trust in the holy grail  
No walls will fall or chains come loose no angel go your bail

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
