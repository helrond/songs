It was a beautiful night when you walked away from me and I swore I would never forget  
Your finger on my lips and my heart in your mouth and you already turning away  
You said love has made us lie love has made us terrified love must bow to fate  
It was a beautiful night when you walked away from me  
You were just practicing freedom

When you signed the order and called out the soldier bearing a lock and key  
You thought it would be a sign to tame the haughty and teach the conquered peace  
The crowd outside chants for truth chants for democracy chants for the king of thieves  
And signing the order and calling out the soldier  
You were just practicing freedom

There was blood on the wall there was screaming in the hall and you said so this is war  
There were pictures in the paper excuses on the radio and your good name on the floor  
Now all the king's horses and all the king's men can't put reality back together again  
The blood on the wall the screaming in the hall  
You were just practicing freedom

It was a beautiful night when you walked away from me and I swore I would never forget  
The way you turned away from me surrendered quietly saying here I am  
And knowing what it would mean the flogging and the tree the sacrificial lamb  
It was a beautiful night when you walked away from me  
But you were just practicing freedom
