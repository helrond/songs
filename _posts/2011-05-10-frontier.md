Where I stood there was water as far as I could see  
It was not the ocean but man it could have been  
And I was thinking of the places where the horizon curls  
Riverbeds and cities named after saints and girls

<div class="chorus">
  I want to stand at the border<br/>
  In a place where they don't know me<br/>
  I want to make it on the frontier<br/>
  Where I can let it out and let it be
</div>

I climbed up the hill and left my stones in a heap  
One by one I  brought them there to lift up the peak  
And I was thinking of the essence, I was thinking of the cost  
Thinking of finding one more way to get lost

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

As a boy a dreamt of riding out on the western plains  
Now I pass through turnstiles almost every single day  
And at every border crossing you'll find these questions there  
Where you've been, who you met, if you have something to declare

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  G/Em/D/G<br/>
  G/Em/C/D<br/>
  G/Em/D/G<br/>
  G/Em/D/G<br/>
  <br/>
  C/G<br/>
  G/D<br/>
  C/G<br/>
  G/D/C/G
</div>
