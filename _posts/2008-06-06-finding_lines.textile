He says I told him something I should have kept to myself
I say secrets are so fucking contagious

Listening to Joe Strummer feel the distance to the Nile
And the cruise control set at seventy five

Business corridors

Heading west and leaving the city behind
At seventy miles an hour

Moosic and the Promised Land State Park

Put it out of gear and let it roll 
Let the wind take the lead for a verse or two
-
Finding lines in the passing air

Fragments of retreads stranded on the shoulder
Circling vultures
Crows dive bombing hawks

Out here we're all the colors of our cars
And we're singing along to the radio

Joe Hardy - 84 Lumber

Watershed, township, county, V for turkey vulture

90's music charts, buckle up for the next million miles
