<div class="notes">at Occupy Wall Street</div>

On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)
Will you remember what happened here (oh oh)
People sitting down and speaking their minds (oh oh oh)
Facing resistance on every side (oh oh)
But I know 
And I know 
It still moves

On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)
Reach out and take a hold of me (oh oh)
But I won't
No I won't
Go alone

On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)
The rain is coming down on me (oh oh)


On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)
Barricades on every street (oh oh)


But I'm told
Yes I'm told
There's room to grow
