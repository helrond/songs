On Broadway and Liberty
Will you remember what happened here
How we felt a little more free
Made space for possibilities
And it's gone
And it's gone
Gone for good

On Broadway and Liberty
Reach out and take a hold of me
The barricades in the rain
The people who had changed their names
It was good
It was good
But it's gone

Oh Broadway and liberty
You made off with the best of me
I was a dreamer and you took me in
You led me on until belief was gone
And I know
Yes I know
I'd do it again

Left me alone and just as broke
Standing in Manhattan in the freezing cold
