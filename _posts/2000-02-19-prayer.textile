This is a prayer for community.
This is a prayer for the cold,
those without homes, those without coats.

This is a prayer for the cold hearted,
those who go through life with their heart and eyes closed.
This is a prayer for those who care enough to make a difference.
This is a prayer for those who commit their lives to a causes.

This is a prayer for those who believe there is hope
and for those who are hopeless, lonely, destitute.
This is a prayer for those who have not yet found God,
But are keeping their minds open.

This is a prayer for all of us and all of them and all of everyone.
Amen.
