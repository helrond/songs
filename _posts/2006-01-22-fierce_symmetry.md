You are muscle and sinew  
Fierce symmetry  
The heat of the noonday  
On a crowded street

You are order and reason  
The spark and the steam  
The chaos of nature  
The storm on the sea

You are vapors and visions  
The captain of dreams  
The words and the kingdoms  
The power between

Oh the shadowlands of freedom  
Oh the deserts of desire  
The loneliness of lovers  
And the sight, the sight of the blind

You are muscle and sinew  
Fierce symmetry  
The cool of the morning  
On the hill, on the tree
