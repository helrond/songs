<div class="notes">for Pop &amp; War</div>

I am a sign by the side of the road  
A boy on a bike with nowhere to go  
I am the shadow, I am the screen  
I am you, I am me

I am a lie that tells only the truth  
I am the perfect shade of blue  
The guns and rice, somebody else's shoes  
I am me, I am you

<div class="chorus">
  An infinite hallway, facing mirrors<br/>
  Everything you want me to be
</div>

I am the trace, I am the dust  
An alien betrayed by lust  
The bastard son, I am the thief of the just  
I am you, I am us
