There is a ship  
To cross over the sea  
There are tides full of power  
There are currents running deep

There are wheels  
Made by human hands  
They are turning in the air and  
Rumbling through this land

<div class="chorus">INSTRUMENTAL</div>

There is a road  
That runs through mountains and dreams  
It is carved into the rock  
And built on gravel and steam

<div class="chorus">Everything's moving, and it's moving fast  
And holding on tighter won't make it last  
Everything's moving, and it won't be still  
So loosen your eyes and your grip on the wheel</div>

There are threads  
Infinite and fine  
Growing from our feet and  
Reaching for the sky

<div class="chords">
D/Bm  
G/D  
Em/A  
G/A (D)  

Em/A/D  
Em/A/D/Bm  
Em/A/D
