It's two stories up to the roof of this house  
Rusting rebar and crows  
From here on a day when the haze burns off  
You can see all the way to the coast  
From here to the coast  

In the alley down below the cats are going wild  
They know what's cooking  
I can close my eyes and see it all now  
Without even looking  
Without looking  

<div class="chorus">
  Ooh, every day that goes by<br />
  Ooh, every thing in this city of lights<br />
  I can see for miles<br />
  I can see for miles<br />
</div>

On a roof nearby there is a farm  
A flock of pigeons and some hens  
They strut around like they own the town  
Like things will never end  
It's gonna end  

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You can climb the stairs at Frere Hall  
Up to the Sadequin gallery  
Across the street behind razor wire  
The abandoned embassy  
Crumbles in its sleep

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
