<div class="notes">Based on a poem by Daniel Berrigan</div>

At Hiroshima  
there's a museum,  
and outside that museum  
there's a rock,  
and on that rock there's a shadow.

That shadow  
is all that remains  
of the human being who stood there  
on the sixth of August in 45  
At the dawn of the nuclear age.

That is the choice before us.  
In reality, that is our time.  
We shall either end all war   
and the specter of nuclear arms

in our own lifetimes,  
or we well all become

shadows
on the rock.
