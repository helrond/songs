I'm drifting further south every day, I'll be  
Past Baton Rouge soon  
Somewhere out across the water lies  
A stairway to the moon  

I have been sailing over troubled waters  
Too deep for an anchor to hold  
I go where the trade winds want me to go  
Tomorrow I will be in Mexico

<div class="chorus">
I'm going up the river  
Crossing the Atlantic, going north to south  
I'm going up the river  
I wish I could be there now</div>

I have seen visions drifting on the breeze  
Under a vertical sun  
In a place where no one sounds like me  
Set my feet back on solid land

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I keep one eye on the weather  
And my center of gravity low  
At the place where the waters divide  
There's a city of gold

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
