Who is left to follow anymore  
For an answer who is there to call  
Monuments and altars, what are they for  
But fallacies waiting to fall

<div class="chorus">
  And the people are building and the house it is strong<br />
  Windows pulsating with light<br />
  The music and laughter it goes on and on<br />
  In those beautiful houses through the night
</div>

Every farmer leaves his lines in the field  
Geometry, chaos and time  
I am just a tenant on this land of these seeds  
But the cultivation is mine

<div class="chorus">CHORUS

At the threshold, bending down  
Left my shoes at the door  
Finding balance in each step  
On uneven floors</div>

Architects and draftsmen; we are residents  
Beggars and saints  
Only by the strength of our longing and praise  
Will Paradises be made

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  F/C/Am/G<br />
  F/C/G<br />
  <br />
  Am/G/Am/G<br />
  Am/G/Am<br />
  Am/G/Am/G<br />
  Am/G/C
</div>
