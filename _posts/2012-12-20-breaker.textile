On the edge of the city the air is thick with smoke
And it's there they drag the rusting hull of ships up on the shore

<div class="chorus">The world is full of people who are building and making do
But someone has to break things down, someone's got to make some room
And someone's got to make something old out of the new
Tear apart the present to give the future forms and possibilities
</div>

Dreams

I am stronger than iron and older than sand
I can tear down anything built by human hands

<div class="chorus">
Broke down
What kind of life is that to live
Broke down
Just how much more have I got to give
</div>

Ship breaker

When your course is run
I will be waiting for you
