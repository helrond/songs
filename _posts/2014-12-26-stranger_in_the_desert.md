Strangers in the desert where are you bound?  
Do you know the place where the lightning comes down  
Tell me who has built these mountains high  
Will you go my way? Will you lend me your light?

Strangers in the desert, is it you that I've seen  
Sailing your ships along underground streams  
In the river beds I feel your hands  
Pulling at my steps through the loose sand

<div class="chorus">
	When you are gone, I know you were there<br/>
	A coyote, a solar flare<br/>
	And I know one day all will be revealed<br/>
	And the space between mountains and sky will disappear
</div>

Strangers in the desert, stand your ground  
Measure out the distance to the promised land  
At the gates of dawn you stand alone  
Through the cactus and the dust, safe at home
