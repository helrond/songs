I want you to soar  
Like a gull into the wind  
But freedom dictates it own terms  
And humans don't have wings

<div class="chorus">
  There are times to sink into a haze of perfect distraction<br/>
  Times to dwell in clarity and times to live in sin<br/>
  There are times to remember and times to regret<br/>
  Times I want my opium
</div>

I want you to rise up  
Like Lazarus from your tomb  
But there is no one to call you forth  
No one to touch your wounds

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I want you to burn  
Like Rome while Nero plays  
But I know too well a fire needs a spark  
A moment to sets hearts ablaze

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  C/G/Am<br/>
  C/G/C<br/>
  C/G/F/C<br/>
  F/G/C<br/>
  <br/>
  Am/Em/F/C<br/>
  Am/Em/F/G<br/>
  Am/Em/F/C<br/>
  Am/G
</div>
