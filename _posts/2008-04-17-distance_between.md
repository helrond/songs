I wanted to talk to the sea  
So I stood on the shore and it washed at my feet  
But I do not live as a sailor or saint  
In the realm of the honest or the reverent  
But the distance between

The mountains were calling to me  
So I climbed to the top of the highest peak  
But I am neither mystic nor mountaineer  
I am all fractions and pieces of dreams  
And the distance between

I stood at the edge of the field  
And tried to talk to the growing seeds  
But I have no farm and I cannot preach  
And there were no parables that I could teach  
Of the distance between

The wind whispered through the leaves  
So I sat myself down underneath that tree  
Neither poet nor woodsman I do not see  
Angels in branches, the slowness of years  
But the distance between
