There's a thousand points of light shining through my window  
There's a draft creeping under the door  
There's a child left standing at the gates of Hamelin  
There's a new tailor for the emperor and  
Running won't save you any  
Running won't save you any  
Running won't save you anymore

There's a drum that's pounding out a martial rhythm  
There's a beggar with a song  
There's a lookout shouting iceberg ahoy  
There's a band playing on and  
Running won't save you any  
Running won't save you any  
Running won't save you anymore

<div class="chorus">
  Down down like a fugitive to justice<br/>
  Down like a stone<br/>
  Down like fear down like thunder<br/>
  Down like hell
</div>

There's a pilot alone over the south Pacific  
There's a tidal wave coming down  
There's an army of fools and they're all laughing  
There's justice fleeing this town and  
Running won't save you any  
Running won't save you any  
Running won't save you anymore

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

There's a line that's forming for the halls of justice  
There a battle for a corporate soul  
There's a young man standing at the foot of the altar  
There's a country going down the rabbit-hole and  
Running won't save you any  
Running won't save you any  
Running won't save you anymore

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  G/C/D<br/>
  Am<br/>
  C<br/>
  Am/D<br/>
  <br/>
  G/D/C/D<br/>
  G/D/C
</div>
