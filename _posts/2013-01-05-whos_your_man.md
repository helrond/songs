He came up from the south  
He was born to let it out  
With a heart as cold as plaster

<div class="chorus">
	It's not worth the bombs or the bullets<br/>
	It's not worth the threats that lead to war<br/>
	It's not worth anything worth having<br/>
	It's not even worth dying for
</div>

<div class="chorus">
	Tell me again so that I understand<br/>
	Who's your man<br/>
</div>
