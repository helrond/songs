I wanted to tell you that this was forever and ever amen
But nothing's forever not even diamonds can last till the end
Am I a companion
Or have I been just a friend
I wanted to tell you that this was forever but we are just mortal men

I wanted to tell you that I was not terrified by any of this
Although I knew even then it would not matter you were scared stiff
Have I stayed the pathway
Or have I gone adrift
I wanted to tell you that I was not terrified but I was nervous

I wanted to tell you that we could do miracles, turn water to wine
And now I see in the dullness of everyday wisdom divine
Have I seen the kingdom
Or have my eyes been blind
I wanted to tell you that we could do miracles God was passing by

I want you to tell me that you are my savior and this will work out
But you can't reply cause you're mired in inertia with no way out
Have I been dependent
Or have I not been in doubt
I wanted to tell you that you are my savior but you aren't even devout

I want you to tell me that there is no consequence to following stars
But of the sacrifice you know as well as I we have our scars
Have I been certain
Or have I been starry-eyed
I want you to tell me that there is no consequence to live by your heart

I wanted to tell you that changes may come and go some things are not new
But now I know that though it may set you free truth kills you too
Have I surrendered
Or have I started anew
I wanted to tell you that changes may come and go but I'm going too
