If I could hold on to both your hands and tie your legs to this bed  
If I could lie without regrets, throw my heart into your head  
If I could be the jury and the judge

<div class="chorus">Still I know that I can't hold you just like I can't set you free  
And the only truth that matters is between you and me  
Still I know that I can't hold you just like you can't cling to me  
And the only truth that matters is the one that sets you free</div>

If I could play you like a fish hooked on the end of my line  
If I could say this world was for the taking that nobody really dies  
If I could turn your life into a song

<div class="chorus">Still I know that I can't hold you just like I can't set you free  
And the only truth that matters is between you and me  
Still I know that I can't hold you just like you can't cling to me  
And the only truth that matters is the one that sets you free

Do you do you want to go  
To a land bright and fair to be walking on air  
Do you do you want to go  
To Heaven's gate to a peace worlds away</div>

If I could hold on to both your hands and tie your legs to this bed  
If I could walk and dance on the water turn stone into bread  
I'd carry you to the other shore
