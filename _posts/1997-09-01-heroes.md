In life you sought illicit loves  
Divorced future kings  
Now you're the "People's Princess". you're  
Flying on angelic wings

<div class="chorus">Death kills our heroes weakness<br/>
Puts haloes on their heads<br/>
Erases uncomfortable memories<br/>
And we like our heroes dead</div>

MLK  
Malcolm  
Jefferson
