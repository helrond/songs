There is a ship
To cross over the sea
And standing at the shore I feel
Rivers in the sky calling me

There is a way
To pass beyond your dreams
To sink to the bottom
And burst through the seams

There are tides
And currents running deep
You could get lost in their power
Or reverse their charges while they sleep

There is a road
Through the mountains and the hills
It is carved into the rock
And built on gravel and grit

There are wheels
Not made by human hands
They are turning in the air
They are rumbling through this land

There are threads
Infinite and fine
Growing from our feet and
Reaching for the sky

Everything's moving, and it's moving fast
And holding on tighter won't make it last

Persistence

undoing loss

Sometimes you need a boat to cross over.
