There is a ship
To cross over the sea
There are tides full of power
There are currents running deep

There are wheels
Not made by human hands
They are turning in the air
They are rumbling through this land

<div class="chorus">INSTRUMENTAL</div>

There is a road
That runs through mountains and dreams
It is carved into the rock
And built on gravel and steam

<div class="chorus">Everything's moving, and it's moving fast
And holding on tighter won't make it last
Everything's moving, and it won't be still
So loosen your eyes and your grip on the wheel</div>

There are threads
Infinite and fine
Growing from our feet and
Reaching for the sky
