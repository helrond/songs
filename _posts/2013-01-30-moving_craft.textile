There is a ship
To cross over the sea
And standing at the shore I feel
Rivers in the sky calling me

There is a way
To pass beyond your dreams
To sink to the bottom
And burst through the seams

You've got to hold on on a moving craft
You can't get to the bottom, you won't make it last

Persistence

Sometimes you need a boat to cross over.
