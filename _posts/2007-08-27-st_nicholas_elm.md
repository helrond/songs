The wind blew down the avenue all night long  
And it blew down a limb of the St. Nicholas Elm  
Hundreds of years gone to splinters and dust  
What was left on the ground I picked it up

You say lately things have been going to hell  
There is less to be known and nothing to tell  
Your body is failing to back up your mind  
And you can't trust your eyesight most of the time

<div class="chorus">
  Nothing lasts forever in these seasons or this weather<br />
  Everything falls apart<br />
  The world just keeps on spinning without reason or beginnings<br />
  And I've got to find my place and my part
</div>

Like Washington you stood your ground  
As New York City burned on down  
You stood by the trail where traders passed  
An island was lost for trinkets of glass

And when we are gone our parting will be  
A change in displacement, a scent on the breeze  
Cracking and twisting with everything else  
We are decaying miracles from our birth

Voices of nature and prophecy
