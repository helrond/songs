I've been up and I've been down
And I've blown through every town
Now I'm crawling on my knees
See what Akron done to me

I've been into every place
And made all kinds of mistakes
All the cops, the guns, the beers
See what Akron done to me

I've known trouble, I've known pain
And I've known the worst of ways
How broke and cold a man can be
See what Akron done to me

Now I've burned up every cent
All my dreams are gone and spent
In the rain at half past three
See what Akron done to me

My good friends, look at me
Lying broken on this street
All the rubber, all the steel
See what Akron done to me
