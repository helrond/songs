Love on the corner of 5th and Main  
Seen through a storefront window pane  
In the middle of the street when the light turns green  
Caught in the lines of history

<div class="chorus">
  I see you my hands are tied my innovation dry<br/>
  I see you another dream another life<br/>
  I see you where you could have been me<br/>
  I see you and my destiny
</div>

Supermarket smile in the dairy aisle  
Name next to mine in the doctor's file  
Yearbook pictures of years gone by  
Turning your head, passed on the right

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Why was my mother born did she  
Find love across the sea  
Why have you been in my life my friends  
Where does fate begin and end

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
