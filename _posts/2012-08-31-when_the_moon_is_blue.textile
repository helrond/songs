Change rolls down from the mountain
Frost creeps up through the ground
Evening quickens and twilight fades
The moon is lower now

I was out for the weekend
Living fast on borrowed wheels
Oh my friends, I had so many plans
I had a head full of ideas

<div class="chorus">Then the music starts
	My plans fall apart
	You'll be out there, I'll go too
	When the moon is blue</div>

Wild asters in the meadows
Apples on the trees
And one light in a window
That is meant only for me

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
