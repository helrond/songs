Change comes down from the mountain
Frost creeps up through the ground
Evening quickens and twilight fades
The moon is lowering down

Birds have flown for the winter
Crops are in from the field
When I first met you I had so many plans
I had a head full of ideas

<div class="chorus">Then the music starts
	My plans fall apart
	You'll be out there, I'll go too
	When the moon is blue</div>

Asters in the meadows
Apples on the trees
And one light in the window
That is meant only for me
