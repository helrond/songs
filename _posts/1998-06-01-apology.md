Our apologies, good friends, for the fracture of order  
The burning of paper instead of children  
We could not, help us God, do any other  
Our hearts see the Land of the Burning Children

<div class="chorus">We're sorry that you had to turn  
But somewhere out there, children burn  
We're sorry that you had to see  
But it's the truth, and sets you free  
You say peace, peace, but there is no peace  
You say Lord, Lord, then you walk out the door  
You say love, love, on your hands I see blood  
And it's crying out to me</div>

We live in the One born to make trouble  
With him walk and with him we die  
On the side of the poor, forever we struggle  
And with that One, up there in the sky

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Thirty years later, the blood is still flowing  
The children are burning, the lies are growing  
Thirty years later, violence still turns  
And we, we know well, our hearts still burn

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

We come here today with God as our witness  
With love as a guide and truth as a shield  
To unmask, disarm, celebrate, announce  
The coming reign of the Calmer of Seas

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Verse: G/Bm/Am/D  
Chorus: G/D/Am/D</div>
