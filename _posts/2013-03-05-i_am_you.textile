I am a sign by the side of the road
A boy on a bike with nowhere to go
I am the shadow, I am the screen
I am you, I am me

I am a lie that tells only the truth
I am the perfect shade of blue
I am the rice and the bullets too
I am me, I am you

I am the trace, I am the dust
An alien driven mad by lust
I am the bastard, I am the just
I am me, I am us


A room of mirrors vanishing to a point

I am cheap or I am free
I am what you want me to be
I am you, I am me

A toy or a tool
A barbed wire fence, a pair of shoes
I am a hero, I am a crook
I am me, I am you

A copy with unique flaws
