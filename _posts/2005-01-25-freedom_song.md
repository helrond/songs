<div class="notes">Words by Nick Trippel and Hillel Arnold, music by Hillel Arnold</div>

I'm happy to be American,  
I love our freedom too,  
Not like all them foreign creeps,  
That hates good folk like me 'n you.

I'm happy watchin' football games,  
On my new flat screen tv.  
I'm payin fewer taxes now,  
So I bought a big ol' SUV.

<div class="chorus">Freedom freedom blah blah blah  
Freedom blah freedom blah freedom blah blah  
Blah freedom blah freedom freedom blah blah  
Freedom freedom freedom freedom blah blah blah</div>

Everything is wonderful,  
No more porn upon the tube.  
Thanks to the folks at the FTC  
We're saved from Janet Jackson's boob.  

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Dubya done did Iraq  
With bunker-bustin' bombs.  
So Karl Rove come election-time  
Could do the same to them security moms.
