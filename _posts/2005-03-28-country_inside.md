It's raining in New York City and the trees are digging in  
Their roots against the concrete; something's got to give  
Standing in the doorway the sky opens wide  
Outside is the city but I got country inside  

<div class="chorus">
  Writing country songs is easy; you don't need a cheating heart<br/>
  A gal who's gone and left you, a dog that's up and died<br/>
  A truck that won't turn over, a horse running wild<br/>
  Writing country songs is easy when you've got country inside
</div>

There's a dog outside the deli staring at the door  
And I wonder who that someone is that he is waiting for  
While I tended to my conscience this city stole my eyes  
But everybody knows me in my country inside

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The pigeons have abandoned the Armory roof  
I wish I could go somewhere; the place that they've gone to  
I'm wishing for horizons, endless lines of sight  
I'm wishing I had more than the country inside

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
