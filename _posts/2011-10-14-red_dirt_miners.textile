Have you heard about the red dirt miners
And the heavy trucks they drove
Have you heard about the price they paid
Have you heard about the heavy load

Have you heard about the red dirt miners
How they built that company town
How they mined those asteroids
How they died there man by man

Have you heard that solar wind
As it screams across the dried up seas
And the darkness of those nights
Have you felt it in your knees

Have you heard about the things they whispered
As they toiled in those open pits
And as the dust storms spun and rattled
How they held onto their wits

Have you heard how they broke that union
Have you heard how they cut them down
How the ships were fueled by their labor
And their blood ran into the ground

Have you heard about the red dirt miners
Have you heard about the heavy load
Have you learned about the tracks they left
In the mountain's dust and snow
