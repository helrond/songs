If all I wanted was to be king I would have called from Mexico  
If all I wanted was to be sober I would have lost you again  
You know I could care less to stand in defiance to watch myself losing control
You know I have burned all my bridges behind me and all I have left is my soul  
When all it wants is truth or consequence

If all I wanted was your hand I would have offered up mine  
If all I wanted was one more chance I would have given all that I am  
You know it's been easy to despise our leaders but they deserve less from me  
You know that the mountain can offer up secrets can whisper into your dreams  
That all it wants is truth or consequence

<div class="chorus">We may watch the mountains crumble and fall into the ocean if we have eyes to see  
We may see the desert blossom and rivers swell with tears if we have eyes to see  
We may listen to the roar of this sweet flood of freedom if we have ears to hear  
We may proclaim freedom to the chains and the captives if we have mouths to speak  
Saying all we want is truth or consequence</div>

If all I wanted was heaven on earth I would have called an airstrike in  
If all I wanted was my own freedom I would have gone in for all I'm worth  
You know it's been easy to turn peace to treason to turn loyalty to hate  
You know that power is not mine to give but it is yours to take  
But all I want is truth or consequence
