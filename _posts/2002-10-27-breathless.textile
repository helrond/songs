Do you ever get the feeling you're drowning like an elephant is on your chest
Do you ever get the feeling you've found where the rainbow meets the dust
And I wouldn't mind losing my lungs to you in exchange for a rib
And I would give all of my power if death would lose its grip
I tell you I'd give it all for more but I've given more for less
If I am clay without your breath with you I am breathless

Do you ever get the feeling you're falling and you'll never hit the ground
Do you wonder then if you were screaming would you even hear the sound
I still remember how you punched right through like I was paper thin
Drained me dry until all that was left was the stain of my own sin
I tell you I'd give it all for more but I've given more for less
If I am clay without your breath with you I am breathless

Do you ever get the feeling of hands around your neck
Do you wonder if surrender is a way to escape death
You and I together are the anvil and the steel
And we are at eternal war like a spoke and a wheel
I tell you I'd give it all for more but I've given more for less
If I am clay without your breath with you I am breathless
