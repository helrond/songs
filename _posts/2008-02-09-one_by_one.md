One by one things are going to fail you  
Going to leave you behind  
One by one these thoughts will desert you  
Leave nothing but you and the sky

One by one words will betray you  
Excuses and reason and trust  
One by one your steps they will falter  
It will all go to dust

One by one you will lose your defenses  
Country, language and blood  
One by one your fears will be conquered  
You will be washed in the flood

Let it fall away, let it take its time  
Let the mountains crave the climb  
Rid yourself of all affection and need  
Cast yourself upon the mercy of the seeds

One by one the rivers entwining  
Mountains and valleys embrace  
One by on there'll be clover and daisies  
Growing over that place
