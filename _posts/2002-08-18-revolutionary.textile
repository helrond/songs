You said you had visions of paradise and knowledge of where we'd been
Then you go walking away on water and leave us to sink or swim
You said you were granted foresight and you knew the fires of hell
Then you go walking away to the bright side saying it's just as well

You said that all your actions were true and mostly you have lost
You said you were called to be faithful and not a success
You said that times were getting hard and only would get worse
Then you go turning away from here denying your place of birth

You say you want peace but when it comes it bores you stiff
Then you go walking the road less traveled and saying that joy is a cliff 
You said that things were this way forever and will be again next year
Then you go turning wine to water and saying the end is near
