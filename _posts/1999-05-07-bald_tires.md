I'm tired of love songs  
One more packaged torn soul  
I want nothing more nothing less than the whole

Through your stained glass eyes  
You tell me you have nothing to hide  
But I know better than that

And I look to the other side light  
And I find myself hanging out tight  
Hold up the roof and hold down the floor  
Push out the windows and pull in the door

'Cause it's a hard day living this life  
It's a hard night when you've lost your sight  
It's a hard time losing it slow as you can
