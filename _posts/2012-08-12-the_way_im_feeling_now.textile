David sang of lions and lambs
I think I know what he meant
And Rumi begged for signs, for stars and wine
I think I've been where he went

<div class="chorus">Are you feeling the way I'm feeling now
Are you believing the way I believe now</div>

Ishmael swam and watched it all go down
I've seen it happen too
Shadrach danced and prayed in the smoke and flames
I've walked miles in those shoes

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The prophet heard and then he spoke the word
And I've read every one
Buddha sat and dreamed underneath the tree
I've felt the heat of that sun

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
