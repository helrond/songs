<div class="notes">for Azra</div>

And David sang of lions and lambs
I think I know what he meant
Rumi begged for signs, for stars and wine
I think I've been where he went

<div class="chorus">Are you feeling the way I'm feeling now
Are you seeing the things I'm seeing now</div>

Ishmael swam and watched it all go down
I've seen it happen too
Shadrach danced and prayed in the smoke and flames
I've walked miles in those shoes

<div class="chorus">CHORUS

Oh my love what kind of storm
Has washed me up on this shore
Alone and afraid I conquered the waves
And I've come straight to your door</div>

The Prophet heard and then he spoke that word
And I've read every one
Buddha sat and dreamed underneath the tree
I've been burned by that sun

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
