And David sang of lions and lambs
I think I know what he meant
And Rumi begged for signs of stars and wine
I think I've been where he went

<div class="chorus">Are you feeling
The way I'm feeling now
Are you believing
The way I believe now</div>

Ishmael swam and watched it all go down
Shadrach danced and prayed in the flames flames

Moses snakes

Buddha
Mohammed

I don't even know
I can't begin to say
What's happening and
Why I feel this way

<div class="chorus">I want you to feel the way I'm feeling now
I wish I could break off a piece and pass it around
If there was a way to share for free what's been given to me
I'd do it without asking why or how</div>

I've been a sailor
Out on the sea
With no wind to catch in my sails
I've been drifting, I've been free

Every day
I own a little less
And I'm giving up my failures
And my need to confess

If if you've
Been feeling like I do
I hope that you would tell me
And we could make it last, us two

I'm flying down the highway
Following a trail of taillights to New York City
And all the passengers on this late night bus
Don't know how I feel.
