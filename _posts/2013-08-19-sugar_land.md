You're as sweet as the stuff that they used to make around here  
And you make my head spin just as bad as a nine percent beer

<div class="chorus">
  Come on baby, come and take my hand<br/>
  I've got an uncle in Sugar Land<br/>
  And we can drive all night long<br/>
  Come on baby, come on and take me home
</div>
