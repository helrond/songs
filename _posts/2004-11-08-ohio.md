Baby my heart is yours forever  
Baby my light is always on  
You know I've got what you've been wanting  
You know my love for you is strong  

Baby you've got to give me something  
Baby you've got to show a sign  
I've just got to have an answer  
My love will not be denied

<div class="chorus">Oh Ohio  
I'm at your window I am calling your name  
Oh Ohio  
Don't run from me don't leave me this way</div>

Baby I know there may be others  
I know you're red, you could be blue  
Baby if I can't be your only  
Just more than half of you will do

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
A/D/Bm  

A/Bm  
A/E step up</div>
