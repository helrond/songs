When I was young I used to hide from the storm
Cover face with hands in a corner of home
Run hug mommy's leg and try not to cry
As lightning flashed and wind tore the sky

I am older now and far from home
I have no choice but to be out in the storm
Dance with death as the lightning bolts crash down
And when i can't see try to feel my way around

<div class="chorus">I look for stars in the night
Fumble east to see the daylight
Will my never life take flight
And my blindness turn to sight</div>

It's easy for me to tell you how it goes
Maybe that's why i think that i know
I can move mountains and crawl through the eye
A needle whose ego is bigger than mine

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Won't you be my light and my salvation
In times like these in this evil nation
I need a little hope, a little joy between hits
And the word is i can't take much more of this

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
