Angelina says to me
There's nothing left to do
And so she pours the coffee out
And cries the whole day through

Angelina says to me
There's nothing left to say
And so she lies about her age
And sleeps the livelong day

<div class="chorus">If the sky should fill with fire hey Angelina don't cry
The tide run out the stakes run high hey Angelina don't cry
The gilded cross the bloody eye hey Angelina don't cry
The time has come to choose your side hey Angelina don't cry</div>

Angelina says that she's
Been driven from her home
And no one listens anymore
To that old jawbone

Angelina says that she
Has seen this all before
And there's no need for her to try
To get up off the floor

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
