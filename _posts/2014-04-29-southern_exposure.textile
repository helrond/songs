I turn my back toward the wind
As the winter blows on in
And think of the summer sun
How it warms the skin

And as the summer days pass slow
How I wish for snow
For the wind that cuts to bone
To counter the sweat and sun

<div class="chorus">
Southern exposure, northern sky
Let me take whatever you bring
The weather in my mind all of the time
Let it be everything
</div>

If I could balance the extremes
On the fulcrum of my dreams
Place the memories of spring
Against the ice and wind

Though I cannot stop the rain
Or the sun or anything
I can seek out the shade
And shelter from the gale

<div class="chorus">
Neither numbness nor dehydration
</div>
