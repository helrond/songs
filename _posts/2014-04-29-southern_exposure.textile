I turn my back toward the wind
As the winter blows on in
And think of the summer sun
How it warms the skin

And as the summer days pass slow
How I wish for snow
And the cold that cuts to bone
To counter the sweat and sun

<div class="chorus">
Southern exposure, northern sky
Let me take whatever you bring
The weather in my mind all of the time
Let it be everything
</div>

Though I cannot stop the rain
Or the sun or anything
I can seek out the shade
And shelter from the gale

And I can balance the extremes
On the fulcrum of my dreams
Place the memories of spring
Against the ice and wind

<div class="chorus">
I will not dehydrate my soul
Grow numb from cold
But will live with what it is
And I will take what I can hold
</div>
