Went down south last summer  
Chasing the sun  
Working for the captain  
Made some friends and I buried some  

Went north into the mountains  
Running from the police  
Blasting tunnels into hard rock  
That's where I fell asleep  

<div class="chorus">
Light travels east to west<br/>
Rivers lose the waters they possess<br/>
All the time you take all the ways you move<br/>
Wherever you are headed, the journey it finds you
</div>

Followed the river  
Heading upstream  
The wind led me through the forest  
There was no one to be seen  

I went towards the sunrise  
Trying to get ahead  
And I wished that I was somewhere  
That was alive or dead

C/G<br/>
F/C/G<br/>
<br/>
F/C/G<br/>
