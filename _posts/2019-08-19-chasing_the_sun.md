Went down south last summer  
Chasing the sun  
Looking for some new light  
On things that I had done  

Went into the mountains  
To find the highest peak  
Got lost down in the valley  
That's where I fell asleep  

<div class="chorus">
Light travels east to west<br/>
Rivers are dispossessed<br/>
All the time you take you will never lose<br/>
Wherever you are headed, the journey it finds you
</div>

I followed the river  
Heading upstream  
And a flood came down the valley  
Took me out to sea  

I went towards the sunrise  
To shift my timeline  
The light took me with its power  
And I could only shine

C/G<br/>
F/C/G<br/>
<br/>
F/C/G<br/>
</div>
