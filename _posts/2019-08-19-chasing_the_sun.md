Went down south last summer  
Chasing the sun  
Looking for some new light  
A place to start and time to be done

North into the mountains  
To change the scene  
But everything reminded me  
Of somewhere I had already been

<div class="chorus">
You can never catch the light<br/>
Or step into the same river twice<br/>
All the time you take all the ways you move<br/>
Wherever you are headed, the journey follows<br/>
</div>

I followed the river  
Backwards to its source  
And I saw that it had taken  
The available course 

<div class="chorus">Chorus</div>

<div class="chords">
C/G<br/>
F/C/G<br/>
<br/>
F/C/G<br/>
</div>
