Went down south last summer  
Chasing the sun  
Looking for some new light  
On things that I had done  

Went into the mountains  
To find the highest peak  
Got lost down in the valley  
That's where I feell asleep  

<div class="chorus">
Light travels east to west<br/>
Rivers run where there is less<br/>
All the time you take you will never lose<br/>
Wherever you are headed, the journey it finds you
</div>

I followed the river  
Heading upstream  
And a flood came down the valley  
Washed me out to sea  

I went towards the sunrise  
To move my timeline ahead  
I was frozen by its power  
Unlearning everything I'd read

<div class="chords">
C/G<br/>
F/C/G<br/>
<br/>
F/C/G<br/>
</div>
