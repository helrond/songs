<div class="notes">in Granada</div>

We walked around the city walls
Our breath hung in the air and dying stars held up the sky
We talked about the rise and fall
The houses that we dwelled in and the way we live and die

Did you mean love or history
Or what could not be seen from just a single point
When you said love, do you not see
Perfection is a place where you and I are not

<div class="chorus">In the end there is only one victor
In the end there is only one God
Wa la ghalib illa 'llah
In the end, in the end</div>

We talked of blood, we ate the seeds
And how our eyes travel and the way we understand
In among the cypress trees
I learned that distance and detail are all part of the plan

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
