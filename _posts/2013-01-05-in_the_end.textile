We walked around the city walls
Our breath hung in the air and dying stars held up the sky
We talked about the rise and fall
The houses that we lived in and how we lived and died

Did you mean love or history
Saying it cannot all be seen from a single point
There's no surprise to this at all
The point of perfection is someplace you and I are not

<div class="chorus">In the end there is only one victor
In the end there is only one God
Wa la ghalib illa 'llah
In the end, in the end</div>


Motion of understanding/comprehension
We ate the seeds
the aesthetics of comprehension
