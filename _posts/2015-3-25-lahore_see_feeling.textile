Went to see a master of his craft
His vision of the future looked a lot like the past
He knew the feeling and knew the way

Outside of the fortress walls
A man was peddling blonde-haired dolls
Walking by I heard him say

<div class="chorus">
	China aa gaya hai
	China chah gaya hai
</div>

The artist up in Glamour Heights
Had the radio on all night
And he wrote every sound down in ink

I walked in on the pimp and his johns
In the mansion where he was born
He said, come on in, you've come from so far away

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When I climbed up the minaret stairs
And I saw the city from there
Then I felt it, Lahore

<div class="chords">
	Am/G

	G/Am/G

	C/F/F/C/G
