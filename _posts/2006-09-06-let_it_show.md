My father is an engineer I am his oldest son  
My mother gave to me every song I've sung

<div class="chorus">Let it show  
I love them more  
Let them know  
I love them all</div>

My sister is a modern girl she lives on rice and beans  
My brother is a carpenter with ironclad dreams

<div class="chorus">Let it show  
I love them more  
Let them know  
I love them all</div>

Though my friends are penniless they live around the world  
In Bishkek, Lima, Pouthisat and one in Kabul

<div class="chorus">Let it show  
I love them more  
Let them know  
I love them all</div>

To all my fellow travelers wherever they may be  
These thoughts go out, let them one day come back to me

<div class="chorus">Let it show  
I love them more  
Let them know  
I love them all</div>

<div class="chords">
G/C/D/G/C/D  
G/C/D/G/C/D  

C/D  
G/D/C  
C/D  
G/D/G</div>
