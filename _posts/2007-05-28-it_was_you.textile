It was not the rain that made me stay
It was you
It was not the sun that brightened my day
It was you
Not the famine, not the drought
The flood that covered Ararat
None of these turned me inside out
But you

It was not this city that captured me
It was you
Not fame or fortune that set me free
It was you
Not the traffic not the night
Not one of those flashing lights
None of these have set me right
But you

It was not the rain that made me stay
It was you
It was not the sun that brightened my day
It was you
Not the famine, not the drought
The flood that covered Ararat
None of these turned me inside out
But you
