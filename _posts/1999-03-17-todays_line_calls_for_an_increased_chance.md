today's line calls for an increased chance
clouded sun, popular indifference
a shot of blood and a pint of hate
sharks rising to the scent of the bait

<div class="chorus">
  give me half a chance<br/>
  to gain my omnipotence<br/>
  give yourself a chance<br/>
  to be more than indifferent<br/>
  peace is taken out to die<br/>
  hope is falling from the sky<br/>
  joy is lost in the river's fall<br/>
  as justice takes the final call
</div>

when did love become hate's favorite game
and peace a way of staying sane
children - collateral damage in our wars
i wish that i could say it wasn't my fault
