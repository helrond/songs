I've been a homesick disciple on these rails  
Trying to fit my faith to a name  
Trying to fit three chord truths into twelve bar blues  
I've been trying to stay honest, to stay true

<div class="chorus">Sing me a song Woody Guthrie and I'll be the man in the moon  
Sing the sun down out of the sky, the wind right into this room  
Sing me water, sing me wine; a song to cast out all fear  
Sing me a song Woody Guthrie and I'm leaving, leaving here</div>

I've been over; I've been so long gone  
On these end of alphabet songs  
I have waited for so long to spit this dust out of my lungs  
Untangle my stumbling tongue

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I went all the way out past the King's Highway  
To see what was left, what ''d find of you there  
At the end of the street there was nothing; not a home, not a grave  
And a rambling man leaves no trail

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
