I've got nothing that I had before  
I've got everything you left behind when you walked out the door  
I'm in pieces all over the floor  
And you're out there getting what you wanted and more

<div class="chorus">Baby I'm delighted  
I'm so excited  
Baby I'm delighted for you.</div>

I've got photographs I've got to hide  
I've got thoughts that keep me up all night  
I'm full up of loneliness and lies  
But you've got more than my troubles on your mind

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
