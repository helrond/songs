Only two things you can't avoid in life, death and taxes  
My father rocked, I sat on his knee, it was a day slow as molasses  
Lazarus pulled up a chair and sat facing Texas  
He started to talk as soft as snow in a voice like broken glass

There are two roads in life said he that you must choose between  
Be careful, though, for often things are not what they seem  
The road of life leads to an altar many fall upon  
The road to freedom leads to jail in Babylon

<div class="chorus">You grant immortality I said, what can I do  
He said you've nothing that I need but give if you want to</div>

You can scream until your throat is blood at the way the world goes round  
But gravity waits for no man and time pulls us all down  
It matters not if you go to war or join the inquisition  
What matters is that you praise the Lord and pass the ammunition

But, said I, you don't pretend to run the underground  
No, he said, but I can call the thunder down  
Loose the bonds of servitude the cops await with cuffs  
You can turn and run like Johnny done try to bluff

<div class="chorus">And on the road you'll find yourself lured by many snares  
But don't cry for the children they can do that for themselves</div>

Only two things you can't avoid in life, death and taxes  
My father rocked, I sat on his knee it was a day slow as molasses  
The wind whispered through the fields, the sky grew dark and gray  
My father spat, crossed his legs and said it looks like rain

Verse: D/A/C/G  
Chorus: D/A/F#/G</div>
