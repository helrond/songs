The Romans walked a thousand paces
Al-Farghani laid his stakes in the sand
And while we've measured distance on land, air and water
We've known space between a heart and a hand

<div class="chorus">And there are miles and miles between us
But no distance at all
And there are mile and miles separating you and I
But nothing comes between us at all</div>

units of measure
pieces of paper between here and the moon
geography
time
borders
