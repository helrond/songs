Pain is not for the pretty  
The fair of face and heart  
We will all I am told be ugly and old  
But pain is not for me

Work is not for the brilliant  
Those with minds strong and free  
And though I struggle at times to find a rhyme  
Work is not for me

Friends are not for those beloved  
Of the stage or screen  
And though I have met with little success  
Friends are not for me

Great deeds are not for the modest  
To make their mark on history  
We all have our dreams of worldwide regimes  
But great deeds are not for me

The truthful must never be lied to  
Lest they hear dishonestly  
And though I am told it is more than silver and gold  
The truth is not for me
