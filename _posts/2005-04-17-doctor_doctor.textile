Murder murder there's blood on the breeze
Doctor doctor won't you help me please
Heal me doctor

Fire fire there's smoke in the wind
Doctor doctor untangle my mind
Strung out waiting on parted waters a bush burst into flame

Liar liar there's a fox with the hens
Doctor doctor I've been taken for dead
Heal me doctor

Murder murder there's blood in the streets
Doctor doctor won't you tell me please
The worst of my addictions is that I am addicted at all
