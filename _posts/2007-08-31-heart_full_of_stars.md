Compared to some you've been around  
But goodbyes still get you down  
Never one to break the news  
And I know how you bruise

You've got ways to hold it in  
To betray the best of things  
All that rage and all that love  
You can never get enough

<div class="chorus">
  And each time you hit the wall<br />
  You stumble and you fall<br />
  Just remember who you are<br />
  And your heart full of stars<br />
  You can buy a brand new car<br />
  Drive it fast and drive it hard<br />
  But you'll never get too far running from your scars<br />
  And your heart full of stars
</div>

Oh your heart and your shoes  
They will go just where they choose  
They will let loose their strings  
You will get tangled in

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You move on from place to place  
As if to test the grasp of grace  
But your smiles and your tears  
Are two things I still believe

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  Am/F/C/G<br />
  Am/F/C/G<br />
  Am/F/C/G<br />
  C/G/C/F/C<br />
  <br />
  Am/F<br />
  G/F<br />
  G/F<br />
  C/F/C
</div>
