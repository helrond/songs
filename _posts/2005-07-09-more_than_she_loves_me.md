My baby's gone and left me for another  
And I've never been so sad and blue  
My baby's left me here to sit and wonder  
Why she won't be true

I saw her last Friday evening  
She said that I had been replaced  
Somebody with more to offer  
Had taken my rightful place

<div class="chorus">
  He's got big brown eyes, curly hair, she says he listens well<br/>
  Doesn't cuss, doesn't scratch, he hardly even smells<br/>
  I've tried to hide my head in sand but it is plain to see<br/>
  She loves her teddy more than she loves me
</div>

Forgive me if I am jealous  
If I oil my gun and whet my Bowie knife  
I swear to God I've never been indecent  
But he's been sleeping with her all of her life  

<div class="chorus">
  He's got big brown eyes, curly hair, doesn't smoke or drink<br/>
  Doesn't cuss, doesn't scratch, he don't tell her what to think<br/>
  I've tried to hide my head in sand but it is plain to see<br/>
  She loves her teddy more than she loves me
</div>

I've been trying to comprehend my failings  
Understand the error of my ways  
It's hard to win when you're competing  
With a bear who's got a head start in the race

<div class="chorus">
  He's got big brown eyes, curly hair, doesn't kiss and tell<br/>
  Doesn't cuss, doesn't scratch, he hardly even smells<br/>
  I've tried to hide my head in sand but it is plain to see<br/>
  She loves her teddy more than she loves me
</div>
