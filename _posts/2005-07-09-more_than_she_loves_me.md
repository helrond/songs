My baby's gone and left me for another  
And I've never been so sad and blue  
My baby's left me here to sit and wonder  
Why she won't be true

I saw her last Friday evening  
She said that I had been replaced  
Somebody with more to offer  
Had taken my rightful place

<div class="chorus">He's got big brown eyes, curly hair, she says he listens well  
Doesn't cuss, doesn't scratch, he hardly even smells  
I've tried to hide my head in sand but it is plain to see  
She loves her teddy more than she loves me</div>

Forgive me if I am jealous  
If I oil my gun and whet my Bowie knife  
I swear to God I've never been indecent  
But he's been sleeping with her all of her life  

<div class="chorus">He's got big brown eyes, curly hair, doesn't smoke or drink  
Doesn't cuss, doesn't scratch, he don't tell her what to think  
I've tried to hide my head in sand but it is plain to see  
She loves her teddy more than she loves me</div>

I've been trying to comprehend my failings  
Understand the error of my ways  
It's hard to win when you're competing  
With a bear who's got a head start in the race

<div class="chorus">He's got big brown eyes, curly hair, doesn't kiss and tell  
Doesn't cuss, doesn't scratch, he hardly even smells  
I've tried to hide my head in sand but it is plain to see   
She loves her teddy more than she loves me</div>
