At the foot of the cross Mary weeps for her son  
He's dying young, he's dying slow  
She's thinking back on how boys grow  
And we still kill our mother's sons  
In front of the TV set a father weeps for his son  
He's dying young, he's dying jailed  
He's thinking back on how he's failed  
And we still kill our father's sons

<div class="chorus">What have we done to our beloved sons  
Is this war lost or is it just begun  
For now we see in part but then face to face  
Now we are under law but then it will be grace</div>

A son full of the Holy Ghost, a son full of the devil  
A son, friend of whores and thieves, a son a rebel  
A mother, wife and seamstress, a father a union man  
We still kill our mother's sons  
A mother host to angels, a father demonized  
A son who turns the tables, a son of freedom denied  
Years between and what has changed since this began  
We still kill our father's sons

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Two sons who came to claim their birthright  
Two sons who burn within our hearts  
Two sons not many of chose to hear either one  
We still kill our mother's sons  
Two sons with mothers, fathers, brothers  
Two sons sent off to the slaughter  
Two more parents left to mourn the death of their beloved ones  
We still kill our father's sons

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
