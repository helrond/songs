He believes in what he does and in what he's got to say
He's got talent to burn; you should hear him play
He is not distracted or bored with everything
My brother the musician; how I wish I was him

He has confidence and faith; he has plans that cannot fail
My brother he believes that things are going to change
His mistakes lie all ahead of him
My brother the musician; how I wish I was him

He knows how to relate and he makes friends easily
No cripple of embarrassment; nothing if not free
Not tied down by anything
My brother the musician; how I wish I was him
