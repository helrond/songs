Everybody needs to turn it up sometimes   
Playing your favorite song shouldn’t be a crime  
Everybody needs to get loud and lose themselves in the sound  
Everybody needs to turn it up sometimes   

<div class="chorus">
  Now all you got is loud music<br/>
  Loud music<br/>
  Loud music<br/>
  Everywhere you go
</div>

Everybody needs to take the microphone  
To hear their voice coming through loud in stereo  
Everybody’s got something to say to an audience from a stage  
Everybody needs to take the microphone  

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

If you know you are never wrong  
And you don’t want to have to hear someone else’s song  
Turn that speaker up to ten you’ll never have to hear noone again  
If you know you are never wrong  

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
