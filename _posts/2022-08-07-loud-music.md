Everybody needs to turn it up sometimes   
Playing your favorite song shouldn’t be a crime  
Everybody needs to get loud  
Drown out the world and lose themselves in the sound  

<div class="chorus">
  Now all you got is loud music<br/>
  Loud music<br/>
  Loud music<br/>
  Everywhere you go
</div>

Everybody needs to take the microphone  
To hear their voice coming through loud in stereo  
Everybody’s got something to say  
Especially if you give them an audience and a stage  

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

If you know you’re never wrong  
And you don’t want to have to hear someone else’s song  
Get a speaker you believe in, turn it up to ten  
You’ll never have to listen to anyone else again  

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
