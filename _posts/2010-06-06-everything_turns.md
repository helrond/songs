They go on everywhere  
Turning up in the air  
Bearing spirits all unaware  
Going on everywhere

And the bones will awake  
They will dance they will shake  
Find their partners and mend all their breaks  
And the bones will awake

<div class="chorus">Everything turns  
Everything breaks, rises and burns  
Everything turns  
We will return</div>

All the shaky dreams  
All the numbers and wheels  
All the visions disguised as sleep  
All the shaky dreams

Watch your doors and your gates  
Bake the bread, shed your hate  
They will not touch you with fire or fate  
Guard the doors and the gates

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When you turn to the truth  
Say the words I am you  
Befriend emptiness love the obscured  
When you turn towards truth

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Am/G/Am  
Am/G/C  
Am/G/C/Am  
Am/G/Am  
(Am/F/G)  

C/G/Am/G  
F/C/Am/G  
C/G/Am/G  
C/G/C</div>
