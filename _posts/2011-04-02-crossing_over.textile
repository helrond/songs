<div class="notes">for Patsy Cline</div>

Well you can shake and swerve and shimmy until you jump right off the tracks
And they'll leave you burning there after watching the crash
But if you wait for the right moment, guard the throttle, grease the joints
You'll be crossing over at the switching point

<div class="chorus">Keep your hand on the throttle
Pay with patience for time
And you will cross over easy to another line</div>

Find someone to sing to

Not to get high; to make the miles
