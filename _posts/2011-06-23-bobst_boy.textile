You can see me on the corner on the south side of Washington hustling librarians
Or catch me hanging out by the vending machines on the internet making friends

I've been running guns out of Mamdouha's office, you should see the stuff I keep in there
I touch Elmer's nose when I take the elevator; I never take the stairs

<div class="chorus">I'm a Bobst Boy
Bobst Boy
Bobst Boy</div>

I'm a pirate in the park, scaring tourists in the dark, you should see the way I make them jump
And I shower in the bathroom and sleep in reserves, I haven't gotten laid in months

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I do my homework in McDonalds, eat my bagels in the commons, I can sleep almost anywhere
And I work every day but I can't live on what I'm paid; I'm often bored or scared

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">G/Em/C/D/G
G/Em/C/D/G

G/C/D
G/C/D
G/C/D/C/D/G</div>
