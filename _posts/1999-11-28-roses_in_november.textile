Between the lines in a sea of blackness, past telescoping signs
This night was longer than it seemed but I was never tired
The shooting stars were out that night, falling just like rain
I was thinking on the morning, I was thinking things could change

<div class="chorus">Do you want to know what lies behind the mist
Do you want to know how many died for this
Can you tell we are already there
Who would have known there'd be
Roses in November</div>

Take a breath, say a prayer, don't look back, there's nothing there
Did I come here for this, is there something I missed why is no one scared
Read the line, drew the line, crossed it out and crossed over
If your conscience bears no consequence who's left to suffer

<div class="chorus">Do you want to know what lies behind the mist
Do you want to know how many died for this
Can you tell we are already there
Who would have known
Roses in November</div>
