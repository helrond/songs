In the fall of change we got high on hope  
Started to believe they weren't just giving us some rope  
Put him in office like his face would be enough  
They were dancing on the roof of the downtown bus  

<div class="chorus">
  What you are waiting for<br/>
  This is not that dawn<br/>
  What you were hoping for<br/>
  This is not, this is not that dawn<br/>
</div>

Man I'm through with hoping, I'm done with thoughts and prayers  
Waiting on things that I wish were there  
You and me, we got to work through the night  
And when the sun comes up, no time to give up the fight  

Occupy  
Gulf war protests  

The ballot box and the bloody flag  
This is not that dawn  
The color guard and the rockets glare  
This is not that dawn  
Thoughts and prayers and the rockets glare  
This is not that dawn  
A changing face in the highest place  
This is not that dawn  

Think I heard the sounds move the the air  
Heard those voices everywhere

Diversity  
Aesthetics of change without the reality  
Representation  
Keeping the door open  
Whoâ€™s your audience and how did they get their seats
