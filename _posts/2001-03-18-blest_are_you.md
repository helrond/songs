Maybe I could fly if I could get up off my knees  
I could swim if I weren't trapped under this sea  
Maybe this desert will dry up in my dreams  
And this song will drown out the screams

<div class="chorus">
  Call me weak<br/>
  Call me a fool<br/>
  What he said was<br/>
  Blest are you
</div>

I had a woman down in Mexico  
Things were hard and one day she let go  
Now I run from the cloud that covers me  
Get on board I'm bound for glory

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

It's much brighter than you'd think down here  
I can see further than you'd think from so near  
Maybe one day I'll get up on that silver screen  
And end these days of falling in between

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  E/F#<br/>
  B/A/E
</div>
