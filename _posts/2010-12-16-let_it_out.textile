You passed it on like some disease
What it's become you can't believe
How it looks and what was said
The thoughts to which that led

<div class="chorus">You let it, you let it out
Look where it's gone
You let it, you let it out
Look what it's done</div>

You wear it out all over town
A secret that's been passed around
Until it's worn through every seam
Until it's obvious and mean

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You put it out on every line
You let it ring and let it ride
Over the wires to your defense
In search of blood and consequence

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/Am/G
F/G
C/Am/G
F/G

Am/C/G</div>
