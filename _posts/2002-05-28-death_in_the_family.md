You were still breathing when they cut your body down  
On a Friday afternoon  
And by the time that they called your mother down  
You had flown to the moon

You were still screaming when they strapped your body down  
In a solitary room  
By the time we recaptured the saints from the sinners  
We'd killed more than a few

<div class="chorus">If the stones could cry out, who would they cry for  
Was it for this destiny that the spotless lamb was slain  
Whose brother's blood is this that cries out from the floor  
Why are we drawn like a moth to the flame</div>

Weighed in the balance you've been found wanting  
For more than your worth  
Now who can transform that stone hanging on your neck  
To heavenly bread

How did it happen you woke up this morning  
Bloodthirsty pack on your trail  
The Hound of Heaven attacks without warning  
Bites without fail

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Raise high the standard of moral persuasion  
This civilized inquisition  
Chosen to burn for the sins that are handed down  
Your father's indiscretion

<div class="chorus">Some say no more victims, some no more abuse  
Some just want the facts, some just want the truth  
Some just want your blood, some want a vaccine  
Some want you swinging from a tree</div>

The world is more than jails and churches  
You are more than your word  
We never wanted to walk on water  
Or meant to take up the sword

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
G/Em/C/D  

C/G/C/G  
C/G/D</div>
