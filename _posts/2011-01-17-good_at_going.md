The first time that you left I was drunk as an eel  
The next time I was high as a kite  
And this time you could say I was distracted by her face  
Looks like it's another lonely night

<div class="chorus">Good at going so wrong  
Good at going where I don't belong  
Good at going places I shouldn't be  
Good at going, that's me</div>

I've been around this world and I've been all over town  
I've been to places too low to fall  
And now you say you are leaving me today  
And I'll be going nowhere at all

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You say I broke the bond and poisoned our love  
You say I have brought you down  
Before you walk away and before you cast the blame remember  
You're the one that's going now

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/F/C  
C/F/G  
F/E/Am/C  
F/G  

F/G/C  
F/G/E/Am  
F/G/C/Am  
F/G/C</div>
