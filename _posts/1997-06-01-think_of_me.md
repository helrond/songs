I'm locked in a jungle of concrete and steel.  
I see only the sky slashed apart by the bars.  
Two bees buzz around my head and remind  
Me of meadows and grasses and flowers

<div class="chorus">Walk bare-foot in the grass and think of me  

Feel the breeze in your hair  
Gaze at the deep blue sky and think of me  
I will be there</div>

God is so great and God is so good  
He made all things with His mighty hand  
He made grasses he made flowers  
And he made you too

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">D/A/G/D

D/A/G/D
