In a maze of whirling color  
I caught a glimpse of a face I used to know  
It smiled at me  
And I turned because I wanted it to go away  
I saw the life  
Of a boy searching for peace and love  
He left his home  
His mother but his home did not leave him

<div class="chorus">Throw out peaceloveharmony  
And eveyone's equality  
Shinyhappypeaceful feeling  
All the rainbow colors reeling  
Push through the haze of rights and hippyites  
The potsmokingvegan needs a light  
Stagger down the stairs to the wall  
Where you see it scrawled

I just want to be happy  
I just want to be free  
I just want to be happy  
I just want to be me</div>

He traveled far  
He traveled further than the farthest star  
He ever dreamed of  
He ever saw out the back window of his car  
But when it came  
Down to what he knew and what he felt  
He couldn't help  
But stop to wonder if all this was what he meant

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">
Am/Em/F  
Am/C/F/G  

Am/Em/F/G  

C/G/F/G</div>
