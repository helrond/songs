Otzi went out one day  
With a bow and arrow some deer to slay  
Otzi went out one day  
Never came back again

<div class="chorus">
Otzi, oh Otzi, where have you gone  
Where did you wander, where did you roam    
Otzi, oh Otzi the iceman is gone  
I will keep on singing his song
</div>

An enemy from behind a boulder  
Shot Otzi in his shoulder  
Left him bleeding on the ice  
Where he froze and lost his life

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Five thousand years later  
Some tourists called in the murder  
When the cops came on the scene  
What do you think they seen  
They said that's not just any old cadaver,  
It's a caveman and what's sadder  
Is he's been here 5000 years  
Since 3000 BC

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Now's he's stuck in this museum  
Locked inside of this freezer  
People come from everywhere  
Just to see him lying there

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
