On Broadway and Liberty  
Will you remember what happened here  
How we felt a little more free  
Made space for possibilities  
And it's gone  
And it's gone  
Gone for good

On Broadway and Liberty  
Reach out and take a hold of me  
The barricades in the rain  
The people who had changed their names  
It was good  
It was good  
But it's gone

Oh Broadway and Liberty  
You made off with the best of me  
I was a dreamer and you left me broke  
In Manhattan in the freezing cold  
And I know  
Yes I know  
I'd do it again
