They are out there and  
They are going to get you  
You can find them anywhere  
But if you look you'll never see them

We're here to protect you  
From them and their devices  
We are at your service  
In a time of constant crisis

They are gunning for you  
You have what they want  
You are after all standing tall  
The first of the first world nations

<div class="chorus">
  I say it's not about being better than them<br/>
  I say it's not about keeping what you have from everyone else<br/>
  I say it's about having the courage to live like a human<br/>
  I say it's about being better than your own self
</div>

If they should ever get you  
What will happen then  
Will you be tortured and burned till you wish you had died  
Or will you be just like them

<div class="chorus">
  I say it's not about being better than them<br/>
  I say it's not about keeping what you have from everyone else<br/>
  I say it's about having the courage to live like a human<br/>
  I say it's about being better than your own self
