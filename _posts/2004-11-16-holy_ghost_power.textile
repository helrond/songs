There's a man at my door, says he belongs to Jesus
There's a man at my door, says he has come to heal us
And everybody knows Holy Ghost Power

There's a man at my door, says he has come collecting
There's a man at my door, says who were you expecting
And everybody knows Holy Ghost Power

<div class="chorus">All the stones of the desert say
Where you gonna run to 
Where you gonna run to</div>

There's a man at my door, says he belongs to Jesus
There's a man at my door, says he has come to heal us
And everybody knows Holy Ghost Power
