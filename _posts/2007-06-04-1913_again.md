Do you recall, do you remember  
What happened on that day in December  
This was our country, my friend  
This was our land

That Christmas Eve, tears were shed  
And the blood of the innocent  
Fifty-nine children paid the price  
When someone shouted fire

<div class="chorus">
  For everywhere a memory is stolen<br/>
  Everywhere the hidden is revealed<br/>
  And everywhere a heart is broken by a song<br/>
  It's 1913 again
</div>

It's a debt you will never clear  
When you're paid by the company  
When they own the ground underneath your feet  
You owe them your memories

How do you keep it together  
When your neighbor is a killer  
You cast a web that diffuses shame  
And misplace all of the blame

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Do you recall, do you remember  
What happened on that day in December  
Do you believe in the past my friend  
Do you believe in the past

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
