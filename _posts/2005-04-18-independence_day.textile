I'll be damned if I will believe this after all the shit you said
You've been lying like a thrift store suit and it don't fit you well
You've gone and shouted wolf one too many times
I'll be damned if I believe this I'll be damned if he is dead

<div class="chorus">I'm breaking orbit, cutting into speed
Gone independent of petty gravity
Dawn is descending, I'm abdicating dreams
On Independence Day</div>

You're kings of wind and thunder and lords of the tomb
You'll crack the bell of freedom and blow the trump of doom
I'll scream it like a banshee if you tear out my tongue
The spheres they danced a two-step on your kingdom coming down

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The sun bounced down off the brass on your chest and it nearly made me blind
But the demons under the porch laughed at your beautiful lies
I'll walk right through this fire and I won't even smell of death
The sun came down on a summer day but I am not deaf or blind

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/G/F/C/E/ Am/G
