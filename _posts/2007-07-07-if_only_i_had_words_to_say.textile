The sunrise from the top of the mountain
The monarch drifting down the valley's edge
The silence that breaks on me like thunder
If only I had words to say

Every one of all my deepest secrets
And all the knowledge yet to be revealed
All my friends and all of my lovers
If only I had words to say

The things that bring me laughter and tears
My part to play here on this spinning world
The things that I believe in without seeing
If only I had words to say

The motion in each word of every language
The color and the shape in every sound
The dancing lines of every human being
If only I had words to say
