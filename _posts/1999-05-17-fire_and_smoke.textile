Shadow of a future present
Present perfect past
Reverse to everlasting life
Forward yet still - last

A chance with luck to tempt your fate
A chance by piece to learn to hate
The lie - work will set you free
We ever give you liberty

<div class="chorus">I see the flames of a funeral pyre in this fire
I smell the smoke of human life in this fire
Where is God in these burning days
Where is hope in death's gaze</div>

The ashes of my father 
He burned - I was stronger
He gave me all he had to hold
Where do you run my father

You ask where is God
Dying of hunger
You ask where is God
Hanging on the gallows
