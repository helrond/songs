If a baptism by fire costs as much as water
If a drowning man can learn to swim
If one more drop will push you over
Then I just might be your cup's brim

If a bishop's head is served upon a platter
If a dog can enter church through open doors
And if the word goes forth so does justice
And the truth cuts like a two edged sword

<div class="chorus">Oh Babylon do you know you're through
When will you learn of your fall
Oh Babylon turn again and live
Surrender all</div>

If their total sum exceeds all of your number
If a prophet can be swallowed whole and live
If all you can see are the legal implications
They'll go slipping through your fingers like a sieve 

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

If the body cannot keep a bone from breaking
If the heart cannot keep the mind in one piece
If the fear on the face of the campesino
Is in the eyes of a dog crushed on the street

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/Am/G
Am/C/G

Am/Em/F/C
F/G/C
Am/Em/C/G/F
C/G</div>
