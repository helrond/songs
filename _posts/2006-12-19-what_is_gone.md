I know a man who only talks on rotary phones  
Full of numbers, memories and poems  
He knows what tomorrow will bring  
Tomorrow can bring

I know a man with a head for machines  
He's got stories, he's got digital dreams  
He's thinking on yesterday  
Thinking of yesterday

<div class="chorus">What's gone is gone  
What is gone will be again  
What's ahead there is nobody knows  
It has already been</div>

I know a girl who says all she needs  
Is a husband, a home, a family  
She knows what tomorrow will bring  
Tomorrow can bring

I know a girl who's got it all  
Strength and beauty, she's got lovers at her beck and call  
She's thinking on yesterday  
Thinking of yesterday

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

In my days here I have tried to match my head  
To my heart and to my lungs, to my legs  
To hold what tomorrow will bring  
Tomorrow can bring

For the last time I surrender for a song  
And the next time I will be long gone  
Thinking on yesterday  
Thinking of yesterday

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
