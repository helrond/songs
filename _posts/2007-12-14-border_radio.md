You can't pay to hear it anymore  
Even if you wanted to  
And you can't hear it on the radio


<div class="chorus">
  Turn it on, tune on it<br />
  It will bring you to your knees and into sin<br />
  Blasting birds right out of the say<br />
  That border radio
</div>

DJs are afraid  
Wolfman  
AP and the girls  
On the X

<div class="chords">
  C/F/C<br />
  Am/G<br />
  C/G/C<br />
  Am/G/C<br />

  F / G / C<br />
  F / G / C / Am / G<br />
  F / G / C / G/B / Am<br />
