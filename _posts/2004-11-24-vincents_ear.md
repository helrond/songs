They say that a few years before he did himself in  
Vincent had a very nasty row with Gauguin  
He went home and took a razor to his left ear  
Wrapped it up and gave it as a present to his dear

To his surprise she did not like his gift much at all  
She called the cops and had him packed off to L'Hospital  
The ear was kept as evidence in an alcohol-filled jar  
It disappeared in the hole of history's black star

<div class="chorus">
  But what happened to Vincent's ear<br/>
  Was it buried six feet under, was it sold for an ice-cold beer<br/>
  Did some junior detective steal it out of spite<br/>
  Or did it end up drifting through the starry, starry night
</div>

They say Vincent was crazy and it might have been the truth  
His style was unconventional his manner was uncouth  
Failure was his standard and loss his destiny  
He was not a darling of the petty bourgeoisie

He loved the sun and sunflowers he loved his cousin  
He painted portraits of the entire family Roulin  
In the yellow cafes at night he'd daub away the time  
But everybody thought him mad, his ear not worth a dime

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

He lived in an asylum, he wrote letters to Theo  
And then one day he shot himself, it's adios Van Gogh  
If Vincent were still alive and kicking today  
His ear would be up for auction on eBay

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
