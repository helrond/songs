Moses carved the law into stone tablets  
And then he came down off the mountain and broke it in the sand  
People do you know how they rose from Egypt  
Wandered the wilderness for forty years without a homeland

<div class="chorus">
  When you read what you believe<br/>
  And you open to the page you had to see<br/>
  When you know before you look<br/>
  When you find it in the book
</div>

Take yourself down to the river  
Catch a spark, catch a fire, catch ahold of light  
Write down every word you heard  
As you progress through seven heavens on a single night

Now I hear them talking about holy water  
Who's gonna end up on the altar and how it's going to look  
There are windows in the walls my friend  
There are prophets everywhere you look, oh children of the book
