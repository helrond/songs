The light coming down over her shoulder burned my eyes  
We were eating up miles to the minute on the road to paradise  
All around was danger wrapped in the robes of false security  
But just ahead the pathway was golden as far as I could see

<div class="chorus">
  And there is so much sky<br/>
  So many paths to cross and bridges to burn<br/>
  So much sky<br/>
  Where our footsteps will be upon return
</div>

Driving west into Ashland County we caught fire along with the clouds  
She said she was thinking of paradise but I know she was dreaming aloud  
I gave up my wisdom I gave up my power I gave up the Holy Ghost  
She said there is always a sunrise once the sunset has passed

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

There is a world just beyond our reach and there are kingdoms in the sky  
There are miracles untouched by humans and there are reasons why  
To see and to hold to hear what is told of the things not of this world  
There is more than is seen or felt, more than your ears have heard

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
