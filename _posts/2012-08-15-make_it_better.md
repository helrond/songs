<div class="chorus">Make it up  
Make it over  
Make it better</div>

When I first looked at the pieces  
All I could see were my mistakes  
And then I started to think of possibilities  
About the things that I could make

How I had let it slip and fall  
And the weakness of my hands

To make something new, something old has got to break

Noticing where things lay

Pieces that were lost and others reappeared
