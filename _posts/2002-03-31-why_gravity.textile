Because the moon can pull the ocean up on the sand
Because I'd bleed for you while I still can
Because I'm a fool for chemistry
Because of you that's why gravity

<div class="chorus">I know there are few heavenly bodies left
And apples on the tree
I'd settle for an asteroid
Or gravity</div>

Because trees grow up and rain falls down
Because I knew I was falling before I hit the ground
Because a river always runs to the sea
Because of you that's why gravity

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Because inertia will always work against grace
Because the only place without is outer space
Because opposites attract but never agree
Because of you that's why gravity

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Because the world is in orbit and I am too
Because it is proven, tried and true
Because you can fight but can't claim victory
Because of you that's why gravity

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/G/Am/G

F/G/C/am
F/G/C</div>
