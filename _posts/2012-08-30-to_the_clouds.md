Oh my love what have we become  
Has distance shaken us down and made us run  
Clouds have drifted in and are hanging down  
Listening to every word and every sound

<div class="chorus">So I will send this to the clouds  
And they will carry what they can  
Someday over water or land  
It will fall down again</div>

And these clouds will disappear like you and I  
All that leaves is taken up by space and time  
And the truth is I am glad of where I stand  
Distance makes liars of water and land

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Oh my love what have we become  
Has distance shaken us down and made us run  
Rain falls down and joins the ground  
The clouds don't say a thing

<div class="chords">C/Am/F/G  
C/Am/F/G  
C/Am/F/G  
Am/C/F/Em  

F/G/C  
F/G/C  
F/G/Em/Am  
F/G/C</div>
