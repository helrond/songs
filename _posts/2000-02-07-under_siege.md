The morning after
Across the street there's a shrine  
The corner store's got a new awning  
And the sun finally decided to shine  

And there's some crazy evangelist saying  
Bridgeport, Jesus loves you  
And the newspapers got a couple of lines  
A lot of people don't know what to do  

<div class="chorus">
  Just how many bullets<br/>
  How many kids is it going to take<br/>
  How many more obituaries<br/>
  Before we see what's at stake
</div>

The kids at the school two blocks from here  
What do they think when they walk by that corner  
Do they know, are they scared, do they want to shoot back  
Is life just like death, you gotta die to be born

<div class="chorus">
  Got a big army<br/>
  Got a lot of guns<br/>
  But you can't stop the river<br/>
  Of blood from our daughters and sons
</div>

A thousand years from now  
Will we all be higher off the ground  
Will cars fly and houses change color  
Or will we all be six feet down

Just how many bullets  
How many kids is it going to take  
How many more obituaries  
Before we see what's at stake

<div class="chords">
  E/Asus2<br/>
  D/E
</div>
