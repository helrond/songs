They're flying it in on a DC-10 tonight  
And it will be all over by daylight  
You won't know how it got under your skin  
If it called or if it knocked before you let it in

<div class="chorus">
  Sugar<br/>
  American sugar<br/>
  You get me high right off my feet<br/>
  Sugar<br/>
  American sugar<br/>
  You get me wired so I can't sleep<br/>
</div>

Got the hookup from the kid who made that trip  
Came back to the homeland with the latest hits  
You got your headphones on and your hands up in the air  
Just like a virgin, you're living on a prayer

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

It comes in hard and steals away your mind  
You will forget everything, you'll go deaf and blind  
Then you'll queue it up and do it all again  
So will your family, so will your friends

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  C/G/Am<br/>
  C/F/G<br/>
  <br/>
  C/Am<br/>
  F/G<br/>
</div>
