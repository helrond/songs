He came up from the south
He was born to let it out
With a heart as cold as plaster

Ali

<div class="chorus">
	It's not worth the bombs or the bullets
	Nit's not worth the threats that lead to war
	It's not worth anything worth having
	It's not even worth dying for
</div>

<div class="chorus">
	Tell me again so that I understand
	Who's your man
</div>
