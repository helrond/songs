Is there anyone here who knows what is wrong with me
Why I don't know what to think, why I'm afraid to speak
And does anyone know what it is I'm doing here
Where nobody else seems to feel the way I feel

<div class="chorus">And I walked all the way here just to discover why
This loneliness I'm feeling has got to be a lie
All the way across town, all the way to the end
All the distance between justice and revenge</div>

Does everyone here know something that I don't
Do they already know  if I will or I won't
And does anyone else feel as nervous as I do
Am I missing out on the obvious truth

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Is there anyone here who knows what is wrong with me
Am I destined like a sailor to be buried at sea
And can anyone tell me about the shape I'm in
And if everything's changed why I can't feel a thing

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">
