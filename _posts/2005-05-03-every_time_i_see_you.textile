Tell me why every time I see you
Tell me why every time I see you
Why it rains every time I see you

Tell me why every time I see you
Tell me why every time I see you
Why you smile every time I see you

<div class="chorus">Thunder and lighting, hurricanes
A runaway freight train
Don't knock me out or loosen my knees
I'm not scared of spiders or snakes
Afraid of the dark or that thing in the lake
My tongue's tied up, I can't even speak
Every time I see you</div>

Tell me why every time I see you
Tell me why every time I see you
I'm a fool every time I see you

<div class="chorus">Vampires and bogeymen
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Don't shake me up don't rattle my teeth
I'm not scared of looking over the edge
Or the monster curled up under my bed
My tongue's tied up, I can't even speak
Every time I see you</div>
