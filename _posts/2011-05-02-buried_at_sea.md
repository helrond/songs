Is there anyone here who knows what is wrong with me  
Why I don't know what to think, why I'm afraid to speak  
And does anyone know what it is I'm doing here  
Where nobody else seems to feel the way I feel

<div class="chorus">
  And I walked all the way here just to discover why<br/>
  This loneliness I'm feeling has got to be a lie<br/>
  All the way across town, all the way to the end<br/>
  All the distance between justice and revenge
</div>

Does everyone here know something that I don't  
Do they already know  if I will or I won't  
And does anyone else feel as nervous as I do  
Am I missing out on the obvious truth

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Is there anyone here who knows what is wrong with me  
Am I destined like a sailor to be buried at sea  
And can anyone tell me about the shape I'm in  
And if everything's changed why I can't feel a thing

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  C/Am/F/<br/>
  C/Am/F/G<br/>
  C/Am/F/<br/>
  C/Am/G/C<br/>

  Am/C/Am/C<br/>
  Am/C/F/G<br/>
  Am/C/Am/C<br/>
  Am/C/G/F  
</div>
