Love is a force that springs from the ashes of hate  
Hope is born like grass from the dirt  
Peace is what is built from the spoils of war  
Even divine beings have a human birth

<div class="chorus">Hey you  
All eyes on the messiah  
All hearts on the infinite truth  
Hey you  
All eyes toward Zion  
To the fountain of youth</div>

From the rubble of empires rises the star of a new dawn  
From the smell of death and the sound of steel comes everlasting song  
Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall if they are of this world  
No one is born with life eternal

<div class="chorus">CHORUS

Just the other day there was love  
Don't throw it away</div>

Might be the greatest story ever told  
Might be a lie, might be truth, might be silver and gold  
Might be God, might be a man, might be something else  
Might be amazing grace
