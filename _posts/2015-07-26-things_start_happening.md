<div class="notes">
	Inspired by http://dp.la/item/febadeab32df38308ab67e4486eade2f
</div>

It was a picture of a picture on a screen  
Of something that might have been  
A print from a foot from an ape  
An enigma, a legend, a fake

<div class="chorus">
	What did you see, what did you see<br/>
	When did things start happening<br/>
	What did you see, could it be<br/>
	You were just imagining
</div>

To some it was as solid as a wall  
And to others it was nothing at all  
A rope or a fan were only clues  
But the elephant was not amused

Some people see legitimate force  
And others a betrayal of the law  
The bullet, the badge and the gun  
An accident or the norm
