Felt the call of conscience trace the palm of my hand
Followed it across the waves and swam into sand
Found myself alone in blackness speaking to the stars
Ancient history of light poured down between the bars

Are you the first the last are you a now or have been
Where are you going what have you seen
I scream at you but you can't hear a thing
Just listen to the night sun listen to the wind

<div class="chorus">Do you know my name
Do you know my name
Do you know my name
Do you know my name...

Time to rise and I heard you fall
One for one and all for all
Do you hear me now
Come on...
Hear me...

Do you know my name
Do you know my name
Do you know my name
Do you know my name...</div>

Names in a faceless world we're all
Trying to live under the pall
Of life without a future here
There's all this noise no one can hear

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Am/Em

C/G/Am/G
F/G</div>
