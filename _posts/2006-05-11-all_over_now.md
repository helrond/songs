Saw it for a dime in 1943  
At the Palestine Theater down on Clinton Street  
Tumbleweeds in black and white, a Picture in Grey  
Jean and Hopsy, Heaven Can Wait

<div class="chorus">
  It's all over now<br/>
  It's all over now<br/>
  It's all over now but the history
</div>

Bought it cheap and sold it on a whim  
You won't hear that 78 again  
And 5 LPs got that phonograph for free  
Blonde on Blonde, the Stones and the Supremes

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Got it every day down at the corner store  
The news that's fit to print and nothing more  
Atom bombs and Communists, Brown and the Board  
The National Guard in Arkansas

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">

  C/G/C<br/>
  F/G/E/Am<br/>
  Dm/F/G<br/>

  C/G/Am<br/>
