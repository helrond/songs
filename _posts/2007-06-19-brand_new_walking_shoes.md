Got me a pair of brand new walking shoes  
And I'll be gone by the time you hear the news  
And if I get to Pittsburgh you will never catch me then cause I  
Got me a pair of brand new walking shoes

Got me forty acres of bottom land  
Underneath the river that you dammed  
All the corn and beans I raised washed right down the drain  
Got me forty acres of bottom land

Got me a Colt .45  
There's no place in this world you can hide  
Nowhere left for you to run from all the wrong that you have done  
Got me a Colt .45

I've got heaven on my side  
And justice will not be denied  
I left him lying there and I looked into his eyes, I said  
I've got heaven on my side

Got me a pair of brand new walking shoes  
And I'll be gone by the time you hear the news  
And if I get to Pittsburgh you will never catch me then cause I  
Got me a pair of brand new walking shoes
