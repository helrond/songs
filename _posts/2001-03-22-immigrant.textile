I am an immigrant flying high above the earth 
Given to second chances and second birth
Ten thousand feet above water somewhere under heaven
And I've lost the trail trying to get home again

I have visions that are flying through my head 
Of chances come and gone and left for dead
Stuck between continents stuck between worlds
Stuck between cultures stuck in this whirl

I have given up thoughts of saving grace 
And fire that purifies from a higher place
I'm stuck with demons that I wish weren't mine
Stuck with this journey stuck with time

I am an immigrant flying high above the earth 
Given to second chances and second birth
Five hundred miles out of Newark many more to come
The place I am going is not my home
