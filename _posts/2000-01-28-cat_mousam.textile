You can walk across this country 
You can walk around the world
You can walk until you can't feel your feet
You can walk to the world's end
You can walk back home and 
But you can't walk half a day with me

<div class="chorus">And you'll never get to these convictions
Don't even try
Disprove these predictions
Or are you just going to die</div>

You can call me a criminal
Before I even get tried
Call me a menace to society
You can find me guilty
In a matter of minutes
You can lock me up and throw away the key

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

My kids call me daddy 
And my wife calls me dear
And to God I'm just another son
But you gave me a number
And you locked me in a cage
You don't even look like you're having fun

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">VERSE: CHORUS: C / G / D / Am
