On the road my friend  
On the road my friend  
There'll be trouble 'round every bend  
On the road my friend

On the road my friend  
On the road my friend  
You'll meet beauty and drown all your sin  
On the road my friend

On the road my friend  
On the road my friend  
Every step leads you on to the end  
On the road my friend

On the road my friend  
On the road my friend  
You'll find heaven around every bend  
On the road my friend
