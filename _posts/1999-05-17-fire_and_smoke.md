Shadow of a future present  
Present perfect past  
Reverse to everlasting life  
Forward yet still - last

A chance with luck to tempt your fate  
A chance by piece to learn to hate  
The lie - work will set you free  
We ever give you liberty

<div class="chorus">
  I see the flames of a funeral pyre in this fire<br/>
  I smell the smoke of human life in this fire<br/>
  Where is God in these burning days<br/>
  Where is hope in death's gaze
</div>

The ashes of my father  
He burned - I was stronger  
He gave me all he had to hold  
Where do you run my father

You ask where is God  
Dying of hunger  
You ask where is God  
Hanging on the gallows
