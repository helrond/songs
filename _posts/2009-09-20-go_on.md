Did you catch me standing in the rain  
Did you catch me a little less than sane  
Did you catch me with my heart up my sleeve  
Did you catch me with holes in my knees  

Did you catch me with my head in the clouds  
Did you catch me dreaming too out loud  
Did you catch me not knowing enough  
Does it give you the feeling you're suchâ€¦

<div class="chorus">Go on and tell me I'm wrong  
You're fighting a war that can't be won</div>

Do you have more of the facts  
Do you have what it takes to act  
Do you have the answer that's right  
Is it the one made so by might

<div class="chorus">Go on and sing your fighting song  
This is just another war that can't be won</div>

I caught you, "Live Free or Die"  
I caught you again, Semper Fi  
I caught you towing your bit of the line  
I caught you staking out your piece of the pie

<div class="chorus">Listen up or you won't last long  
If you're fighting a war, you won't be one  
So go on and tell me what is on  
What you haven't lost is what you've won</div>
<div class="chords">C/Am/G/F  
F/C/G</div>
