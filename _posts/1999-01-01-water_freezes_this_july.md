water freezes this july  
burning kisses fall from the sky  
humanity sinks out of sight  
the sun's caresses give way to night

in africa the desert's frozen  
artic water boils to the yellow skies  
noah's ark is slowly sinking  
this world we've blown is lost to our eyes

last night I heard the screaming   
went outside to watch them fall from the sky  
tonight I hear the screaming  
of a world that's not quite ready to die  

it's because we loved our children  
it's because we had to keep up with someone else  
it's because we need inventory  
this is our final love song for the earth

<div class="chorus">
  BRIDGE:<br/>
  this ain't no hippie thing<br/>
  love your mother, hug a tree<br/>
  if there's nothing to wake up to tomorrow<br/>
  it's gonna be a hell of a long sleep
</div>

it's because we loved our children  
it's because we had to keep up with someone else  
it's because we need inventory  
this is our final love song for the earth
