I've got nothing that I had before
I've got everything you left behind when you walked out the door

<div class="chorus">Baby I'm delighted
I'm so excited
Baby I'm delighted for you.</div>

We don't all get what we deserve
But you're going to get what you want

And I know you've bee trying to do the right thing
But lying to someone who loves you is about the worst thing you can do
