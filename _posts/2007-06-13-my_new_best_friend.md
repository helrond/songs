I see people I know almost everywhere  
I have friends wherever I go  
We have done for each other the best that we can  
To keep out the dark and the cold

<div class="chorus">
  You<br/>
  It could be you<br/>
  You could be the one to defend<br/>
  You<br/>
  You could change my mind<br/>
  You could be my new best friend
</div>

I hear the voices of my friends  
Everywhere that I go  
Their clothing and their favorite songs  
Become my own

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

My friends let me remember you  
When I am alone  
And dying be surrounded by  
Faces I know

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
