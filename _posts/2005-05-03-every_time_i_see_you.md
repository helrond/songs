Tell me why every time I see you  
Tell me why every time I see you  
Why it rains every time I see you  

Tell me why every time I see you  
Tell me why every time I see you  
Why you smile every time I see you  

<div class="chorus">
  Thunder and lighting, hurricanes<br/>
  A runaway freight train<br/>
  Don't knock me out or loosen my knees<br/>
  I'm not scared of spiders or snakes<br/>
  Afraid of the dark or that thing in the lake<br/>
  My tongue's tied up, I can't even speak<br/>
  Every time I see you
</div>

Tell me why every time I see you  
Tell me why every time I see you  
I'm a fool every time I see you

<div class="chorus">
  Vampires and bogeymen<br/>
  All the king's horses, all the king's men<br/>
  Don't shake me up don't rattle my teeth<br/>
  I'm not scared of looking over the edge<br/>
  Or the monster curled up under my bed<br/>
  My tongue's tied up, I can't even speak<br/>
  Every time I see you
</div>
