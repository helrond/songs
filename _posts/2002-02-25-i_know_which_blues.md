<div class="notes">Title by Josh Gardner</div>

I wish you would tie me up and throw me on the tracks  
I wish you'd watch that train bear down I wish that you would laugh  
I wish you'd sew me in a bag and weigh it down with stones  
I wish you'd watch me from the deck as I dine with Davey Jones

<div class="chorus">
  Why don't you go on and break me this time<br/>
  I am not deaf I am not blind<br/>
  Why don't you go on and kill me this time<br/>
  I will not grumble I will not mind
</div>

I wish that you would blindfold me and fill me full of lead  
I wish you'd call down vengeance and dance for my head  
I wish that you would tie the noose I wish you'd drop the door  
And as I swing there writhing tell me you're really bored

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I wish that you would sit me down and strap me to that chair  
I wish that you would pull the switch and tell me go to hell  
I wish you'd run me over then say I'm in a rut  
I wish you would disembowel me then say I have no guts

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I wish you'd be impossible I wish you'd talk too much  
I wish you'd be demanding that you'd say I've lost my touch  
I wish that you would lie I wish that you would cheat  
I would say love or leave but I know which it would be

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">G/Am</div>
