Oh my love what have we become
Has distance shaken us down and made us run
Clouds have drifted in and are hanging down
Listening to every word and every sound

And the invisible is swarming around
An illusion of the desperate and the drowned 
How could they carry all these words we never said
With their bellies full of rain and wanderlust inside their heads

<div class="chorus">So I will send this to the clouds
And they will carry what they can
Someday over some other land
It will fall down again</div>

And when clouds have disappeared into the sky
Like nothing ever leaves but is just replaced
You and I have never been as close as we now stand
Distance makes liars of water and land

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Oh my love what have we become
Has distance shaken us down and made us run
Rain falls down and joins the ground
The clouds don't say a thing

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">C/Am/F/G
Am/C/F/Em
C/Am/F/G
Am/C/F/Em

F/G/C
F/G/C
F/G/Em/Am
F/G/C</div>
