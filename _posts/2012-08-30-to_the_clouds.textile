Oh my love what have we become
Has distance shaken us down and made us run
Rain falls down and joins the ground
The clouds don't say a thing

Wait for rain or at least a cloudy day

Things aren't erased, they are only overwritten.

Illusions of water and temperature 
That distance has turned into solid ground
Ghosts of the atmosphere blown by the wind with bellies full of rain

Clouds are hanging down around our heads
Listening to every word that's said

<div class="chorus">So I will send this to the clouds
And they will carry what they can
Someday over some other land
It will fall down again</div>

Science or magic, or whatever you accept
