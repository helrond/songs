Oh my love what have we become
Has distance shaken us down and made us run
Clouds have drifted in and are hanging down
Listening to every word and every sound

<div class="chorus">So I will send this to the clouds
And they will carry what they can
Someday over some other land
It will fall down again</div>

And these clouds will disappear into the sky
For nothing leaves but is replaced by space and time
We have never been as close as where we stand
Distance makes liars of water and land

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Oh my love what have we become
Has distance shaken us down and made us run
Rain falls down and joins the ground
The clouds don't say a thing

<div class="chords">C/Am/F/G
Am/C/F/Em
C/Am/F/G
Am/C/F/Em

F/G/C
F/G/C
F/G/Em/Am
F/G/C</div>
