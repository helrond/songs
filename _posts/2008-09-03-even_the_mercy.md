Always one more rock in the field  
You can't keep ahead of the weeds  
And the landlord has got be paid  
And the weather takes its time  
You can't make it rain or shine  
You can't stop it coming down like Judgment Day

<div class="chorus">And even the mercy  
Even the mercy  
Even the mercy it burns</div>

And the margins are too slim  
To pay off the debt you're in  
It will take what you give and demand more  
The crops that you have grown  
From seeds not your own  
Will be gone, will be gone, will be gone

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The boss he holds the deed  
And the clay won't hold the seeds  
But you sow, and you sow, and you sow  
And the law is running scared  
Washington don't care  
You will get by with who you know

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
