You're dumb, you're ugly and yes I'm talking to you  
You're weird, you're clumsy, you eat disgusting food  
You have no dignity; you act like such a fool  
You're dumb, you're ugly I can barely look at you

<div class="chorus">I don't care who you think you are  
I'm a cat named after a movie star  
I don't care what you think of me  
I'm a cat, worship me</div>

That's it, you've done it now, you woke me up again  
Dot try to talk to me, I am not listening  
Those pigeons are more interesting than you could ever hope to be  
I know I'm cute, I know I'm sweet, don't say it again

<div class="chorus">I don't care who you think you are  
I'm a cat named after a movie star  
I don't care if you think I'm rude  
I'm a cat with attitude</div>

I don't mean to be cruel or thoughtless; I'm just telling the truth  
There are moments when I actually think I sort of like you  
I love that game we play with my mouse, I hide it under the couch and you get it out  
And rub my head, now let me go, that will do

<div class="chorus">I don't care who you think you are  
I'm a cat named after a movie star  
I don't care what you think of that  
I'm a cat so kiss my ass</div>
