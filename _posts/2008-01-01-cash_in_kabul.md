Silence reigns in the beauty parlor  
Rusting Russian tanks and empty American shells

<div class="chorus">
  Cash in Kabul (You know where we're at man)<br />
  Cash in Kabul (All day long)<br />
  Cash in Kabul (I just want the facts man)<br />
  Cash in Kabul (All night long)
</div>

And I walked in holding my guidebook

If I am an immigrant in my own country  
Then what am I here
