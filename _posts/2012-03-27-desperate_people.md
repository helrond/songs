Desperate people will do anything  
If a door is locked they will kick it in  
And if you dare to cross them, you will see  
Desperate people are dangerous and mean  

<div class="chorus">
  They might be the ones to bring it crashing down<br/>
  To tear down the walls and let justice roll on down<br/>
  And they will end what they begin<br/>
  Desperate people do desperate things
</div>

Desperate people will believe anything  
That will lift them up or let them in  
Desperate people don't care about wrong or right  
As long as it will get them through the night

Desperate people aren't scared of anything  
Society or consequence, laws or discipline  
They don't have principles, they'll act on any whim  
Desperate people are up for anything
