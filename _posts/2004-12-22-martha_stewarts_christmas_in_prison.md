<div class="notes">Trippel/Arnold via John Prine</div>

It was Christmas in prison and the food ain't real good  
I had turkey and pistols carved out of wood  
I done tried some baking but it's hard without cream  
My brands on your shelf, and my show's on your screen.

<div class="chorus">Wait aw	hile for my return to TV  
The Department of Justice has nothing on me  
Email me, cell phone me, dump the shares now  
I'm wheelin' and dealin' and appealin', by God</div>

My website has posted a Holiday greetin'  
So please buy my china though I won't be eatin'  
My heart is as big as this whole goddamn jail  
But I'll let Omnimedia drop the coin for my bail

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The search light in the big yard swings round with the gun  
And spotlights the snowflakes like the dust in the sun  
It's Christmas in prison there'll be music tonight  
I'll probably get homesick I love you, goodnight.
