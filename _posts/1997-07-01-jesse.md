It's May, dogwood's blooming  
Spring fever, first mowing  
Life is blooming, life is trying  
Nobody thinks about dying  

<div class="chorus">Never laughed, he never cried never born, he never died<br/>
Never skinned his knees played tag with the breeze<br/>
But after all he's still my brother</div>

Dust to dust I hear it now  
The same words have changed somehow  
I've learned it then, I've learned again  
Grace is delivered by pain  

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

One day we'll run out of time  
And they will not bury all we've left behind  
We must carry what we hold on to  
Release what you love, let it come back to you  

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">D/A/G/A</div>
