Standing on the platform waiting for the flood  
Waiting for anything that would be enough  
I hold my head up

With a choice I'll take the window seat  
I'll turn my head and hold my peace  
And I will hang my coat up  

<div class="chorus">
  I tell myself it's honest work<br/>
  Tell myself I'm doing it for you<br/>
  But you I have not seen in quite some time
</div>

Express trains have the right of way  
It's not like I had much to say  
To you anymore

The local train gets more delayed  
The further it goes on its way  
And you walked out that door  

<div class="chorus">
  Cigarette smoke and coffee stains<br/>
  These are the things that I call home<br/>
  And home I have not been in quite some time
  </div>

I'm living halfway underground  
With the curtains drawn I'm not about  
To go losing my cool

I dodge the talkers and the transit cops  
Conductors with their belts full of ticket stubs  
I've been such a fool  

<div class="chorus">
  In this city where it never rains<br/>
  And we are always at war<br/>
  The enemy is impossible to find
</div>

<div class="chords">
  Em<br/>
  C<br/>
  Em/C<br/>
  <br/>
  C<br/>
  G/D<br/>
  D/Em
</div>
