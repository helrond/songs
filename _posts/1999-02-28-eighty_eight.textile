O Lord, I call for help by day
I cry out in the night before you
Let my prayer come before you
Incline your ear to my cry

<div class="chorus">What do you want from me</div>

But I, I cry to you
In the morning my prayer comes to you
Why do you hide from me
Leave me to drown in the terror of the night

<div class="chorus">What do you want from me</div>
<div class="chords">G/D/C/D</div>
