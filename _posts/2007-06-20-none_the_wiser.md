When I was seventeen I was ruthless and mean  
And I knew every trick in the book  
And I brought close to tears everyone I held dear  
When I was seventeen

When I was twenty one I could not be outdone  
And I knew that the world could be saved  
And I thought about sin, I had ideals then  
When I was twenty one

<div class="chorus">
  Oh, I please forgive me<br />
  Oh, I was young<br />
  Oh, I grow none the wiser<br />
  The older I become
</div>

When I was twenty four I was reckless and bored  
And I stole every word that I spoke  
And I could not ignore how it felt to be poor  
When I was twenty four

When I was twenty eight, man I worked every day  
And I stayed up late at night  
And I practiced my faith and I tried not to hate  
When I was twenty eight

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When I am twenty nine I will know what is mine  
And I will give it away  
And each day I will try to be more like a child  
When I am twenty nine

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
