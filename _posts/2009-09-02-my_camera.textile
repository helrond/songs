You are a liar
When you turned to me and said
Turned to me and said

Here it is; my desire
In shades of blue and green and red
Blue and green and red

<div class="chorus">If I knew what you would find
In the eyes of my own mind
I would have been so much less kind
My camera</div>

You are much wiser
Than you have any right to be
Any right to be

Back then things were brighter
And they came on easily
Came on easily

<div class="chorus">When I saw what could be blamed
On the light and on the frame
I should have dropped you without shame
My camera</div>

You are a reminder
Of the desert and the sea
The mountains and the streams

After this what you require
Is nothing that you need
Nothing that you need

<div class="chorus">If we've looked and disagreed
On the way things go from here
You have always been sincere
My camera</div>
