The way you wear your life like it's something you have won  
And the way you've given in on the things not yet begun  
I am casting about to find the right words to say  
To fill your nets and calm your waves

<div class="chorus">
  So how you gonna win you can't beat this thing<br/>
  By drawing lines in the sand<br/>
  So if you want out the only way now<br/>
  Is to throw in your hand
</div>

So you can go and fight that war for a spot on which to stand  
You can rape and pillage, loot and burn turn cities into sand  
And you can touch the lips of Helen make war on Genghis Khan  
But the Gates of Heaven still stand strong

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

So you want to make yourself holy and free  
And love like a hurricane or a symphony  
After all of this do you still wait for a sign  
A potion or a line

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  G/D/C/D<br/>
  G/D/C/D<br/>
  G/D/C/D<br/>
  C/D/G<br/>
  <br/>
  G/C<br/>
  G/D<br/>
  G/C<br/>
  G/D
</div>
