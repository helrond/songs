She was born the youngest of seven
In a three-room bungalow
Wrestling hurricanes and rattlers
With a rifle and a hoe

The boys lined up at county fairs
To swing her do-si-do
And with empty pockets, worn out shoes
They crawled off alone

<div class="chorus">None could outsmart or claim her heart
Or follow the way she goes
None is as tender, none is as fierce
As my Birmingham Rose</div>

Grew corn and beans and babies
Out of that rocky ground
And she stood on the porch with that shotgun on her hip
When the taxman came around

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Lost her grandfather to Sherman
And a grandson to Vietnam
She could pick a bale every day
There was iron in those hands

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They say she's lived forever
They say she'll never die
As long as trees grow from these hills
And rain falls from the sky

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/C
