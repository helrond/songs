It was underneath the willows on a sultry night in June  
I went walking with my true love out underneath that moon  
We tickled and we tussled, we huggled and we kissed  
Oh girl you looked like Minnie Pearl, but you kissed just like Judas

<div class="chorus">
  Hey hey hey hey what can I say<br/>
  She tore me up, she led me astray<br/>
  Hey hey hey hey what could I do<br/>
  She was unfaithful, she was untrue
</div>

It was earlier that spring when our courting had commenced  
When I first had kissed her across the old stone fence  
She would send me love letter written in verse  
Oh girl you wrote like William Shakespeare, but you kissed just like Judas

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Then it was autumn, I was running from the law  
I had shot and killed a man who had cheated my grandpa  
She said that she would lie for me no matter who would ask  
Oh girl you spoke like Jesse James, but you kissed just like Judas

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

So the moral of this story for those still listening  
Is don't mistake truth and kisses, lovers and friends  
If somebody should say they'd gladly die for you  
Remember they told that to Jesus too

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
