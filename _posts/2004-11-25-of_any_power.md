Place the blame on anybody  
Claim that you don't care  
Say the world is lost forever  
But don't say you're scared

Say you'll move to Canada  
You'll never vote again  
But don't say you're scared forever

Don't fear tomorrow  
don't bow down  
Do not be frightened  
of any power  
Don't fear the dawning  
Don't be cowed  
Do not be frightened  
Of any power
