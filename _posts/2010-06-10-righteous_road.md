Gotta keep walking that righteous road  
Gotta take up that heavy load  
Pick your head up off the floor  
Get your feet out of the door

<div class="chorus">
  Make your way out of the city<br/>
  Make your way across town
</div>

Gotta keep walking that righteous road  
Gotta believe the things I know  
Takes more than this world can bring  
To find out the shape I'm in

<div class="chorus">
  Make your way from consolation<br/>
  Make your way through rocky ground
</div>

Gotta keep walking that righteous road  
Gotta lay down that heavy load  
Forget about the things you lose  
Make your life some kind of use

<div class="chorus">
  Make your way from all concession<br/>
  Make your way back to yourself
</div>

<div class="chords">
  Am/C/G/F<br/>
  <br/>
  Am/G<br/>
  Am/G
</div>
