<div class="notes">with Alvin Arnold</div>

It's the way the river talks to me at sunrise
It's the faith I have when I am all alone
It's the knowledge that everywhere is nowhere
And I must be going home

It's the glimpse of the runway before takeoff
Departing points all fading into one
It is knowing that home is for the asking
And there is nowhere left to run

<div class="chorus">And the road it is long
And the road leads me on</div>

It's the way the road is rising up to meet me
It's the truth that I can never escape; you
It's the knowledge of the joy inside each sorrow
The arrival each departure knew

It's the way all of our ends are our beginnings
It's the way my body returns into dust
It is knowing that all will be forgiven
The enigma of motion and trust

<div class="chorus">And the road it is long
And the road leads me on
And the road it is long
And the road leads me on</div>

It's the way the river talks to me at sunrise
It's the faith I have when I am all alone
It's the knowledge that everywhere is nowhere
And I must be going home
