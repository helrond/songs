When all that is left is your enemy's word  
And nobody else knows what you saw and heard  
Don't doubt yourself or your memory  
Or what happened there among the beasts of the field  
When time stood still

They called you a shepherd, an ignorant youth  
A piper, a dancer, a leader of fools  
But the bishops and counts are trembling in fear  
Thinking of a time when these walls will disappear  
When time stood still

<div class="chorus">
  There'll be blood on the altar; they'll be dancing on drums<br />
  There will be no more mysteries, only angry songs<br />
  In the dancing of the spheres find the dissonant strains<br />
  Make music your protector; take fire as your friend
</div>

Poverty it breeds with fear  
The carnival takes to the city streets  
No time for depression, no thought for the past  
All of those leading become last  
When time stood still

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

In '76 in the winter's cold  
In the barren fields there bloomed a rose  
You went walking the borders of sanity  
And dreaming of justice not fantasy  
When time stood still

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  VERSE:<br />
  Am/Em<br />
  G/F<br />

  CHORUS:<br />
