Hold on Birmingham
There's a storm coming through
It will leave you with dust in your hand
Working on your dehydration blues
Working on your dehydration blues

Hole up San Antone
With your cards and your booze
Drink away what you cannot lose
Try to drown your dehydration blues
Try to drown your dehydration blues

Stay strong Buffalo
I've got shelter for you
I've got pills to get me through
Get me through these dehydration blues
Get me through these dehydration blues

Hold on while you can
There's a flood coming soon
It will run through your worn out shoes
Wash away your dehydration blues
Wash away your dehydration blues
