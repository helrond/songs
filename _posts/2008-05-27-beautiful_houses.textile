Who is left to follow anymore
For an answer who is there to call
Monuments and altars, what are they for
But fallacies waiting to fall

<div class="chorus">And the people are building and the house it is strong
Windows pulsating with light
The music and laughter it goes on and on
In those beautiful houses through the night</div>

Every farmer leaves his lines in the field
Geometry, chaos and time
I am just a tenant on this land of these seeds
But the cultivation is mine

<div class="chorus">CHORUS

At the threshold, bending down
Left my shoes at the door
Finding balance in each step
On uneven floors</div>

Architects and draftsmen; we are residents
Beggars and saints
Only by the strength of our longing and praise
Will Paradises be made

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">F/C/Am/G
F/C/G

Am/G/Am/G
Am/G/Am
Am/G/Am/G
Am/G/C</div>
