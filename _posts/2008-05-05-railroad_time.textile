As a blue eyed boy of almost ten I
Went down by the train
A hobo's life I planned as I
Put pennies on the rails
Steel on steel
Boxcars and wheels

The bus I took away from there
It stopped in every town
And I found a place without a plan
My work was in my home
Nothing but dreams
Left up to me

<div class="chorus">Everything wants to be free
Except what you love and what you need
All alone without words or deeds
Spring comes quietly</div>

Lacking courage and direction I
Sat down upon the shore
Wanting nowhere to belong and no more
Turnstiles or doors
Seconds or signs
Landmarks or lines

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Yesterday at half past ten I
I went down by the train
Where I stood without reception, laid it
Down upon the rails
Forgot my path
My debts and maps

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">D/G/D
