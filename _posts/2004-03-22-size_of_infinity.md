As if I could say he's not my president to be cleared of any crime  
As if the only cause worth fighting for is my own private life  
As if I could say that walking away is just acting polite  
As if you were wrong and I was right

<div class="chorus">I've been losing faith in the things that carry me  
Losing my hope in the unseen  
Losing love for my leaders but I still believe  
In the size of infinity</div>

As if I could say things would be different with a change in regime  
As if I could further both a compromise and my integrity  
As if the color of my blood is purple and not red  
As if I was good and you were bad

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

As if I could say that when I'm on my knees it's not idolatry  
As if all there is to happiness is life and liberty  
As if I could shrug and say the truth is what you lie about  
As if I was in and you were out

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
G/D/Em/C/G/D/G  
G/D/Em/C/G/D/G  
C/D/G/C/Em  
C/D/C/G  

C/G
