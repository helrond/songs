Don't turn your back on the ocean  
Or a wave will take you in  
Battled for you with the current  
The undertow will win

Don't turn your back on the ocean  
Or you'll let the moment pass  
You'll be stranded with nothing  
But regret of the past

Don't turn your back on the ocean  
You don't know what's watching you  
Waiting for the moment  
You least expect it to

Don't turn your back on the ocean  
When there's nowhere else to go  
There are winds to bring  
The weary traveler home

Don't turn your back on the ocean  
When you hear the siren's call  
She is out there waiting  
She will catch you when you fall
