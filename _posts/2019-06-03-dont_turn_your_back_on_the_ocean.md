Don't turn your back on the ocean  
Or a wave will take you in  
You are no match for that current  
To the undertow you are nothing

<div class="chorus">
  You got yourself out there<br/>
  And there's nothing that can save you now<br/>
  Nothing that can save you<br/>
</div>

There are tides in the ocean  
That will pull you far from shore  
And winds to carry you  
Where you have never been before

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I lost myself by the ocean  
To the sound of a sea birds's call  
When your arms reached out to me  
There was nowhere else to fall

<div class="chorus">
  I got my self out here<br/>
  And there's nothing that will save me now<br/>
  Nothing that will save me<br/>
</div>

<div class="chords">
  C/Am/F/G<br/>
  <br/>
  F/G/Am<br/>
  F/G<br/>
  F/G/C<br/>
 </div>
