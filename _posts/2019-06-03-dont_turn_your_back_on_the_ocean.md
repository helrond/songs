Don't turn your back on the ocean  
Or a wave will take you in  
You are no match for that current  
To the undertow you are nothing

<div class="chorus">
  You got yourself out there<br/>
  And there's nothing that can save you now<br/>
  Nothing that can save you<br/>
</div>

Don't turn your back on the ocean  
When there's nowhere else to go  
There are winds and waves to bring  
The weary traveler home

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Don't turn your back on the ocean  
When you hear the siren's call  
When her arms reach out to you  
There'll be nowhere else to fall

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  C/Am/F/G<br/>
  <br/>
  F/G/Am<br/>
  F/G<br/>
  F/G/C<br/>
 </div>
