Silence is a place where you go all alone  
The mirror in the hallway, a broken telephone  
Where all of the absence and misplaced intentions don't seem too much to hold  
Silence is a place and you go there alone

<div class="chorus">
  Spin me around drop that needle down<br/>
  You've got to find a way to say what you've got to say
</div>

Silence is a place where you go when there's nowhere else  
The drawbridge to your refuge, the last line of defense  
The battlements erected by the weight of the unsaid  
Silence is a place when there's nowhere else

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Silence is a place where you go with those you love  
The language of perfection, the element of trust  
Wider than the ocean, deeper than the sky  
Silence is a place and you go there in love

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  D/A/Bm/G/A<br/>
  D/A/Bm/G/A<br/>
  G/A/D/A/Bm<br/>
  G/A/Bm/G/D/A/D<br/>
  <br/>
  G/D/A
</div>
