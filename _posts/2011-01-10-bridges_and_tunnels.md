Take the road through the heart of the mountain  
Or the bend in the river tonight  
The blood in your veins, the steam in your trains  
All the miles they have brought into sight

And I stood and I saw there a kingdom  
Built of highways, channels and wires  
All round my head there are waves being read  
By the road there are shrines

<div class="chorus">And a bridge takes you over  
Tunnels cut right on through  
Knowing your need for motion and speed  
The will finds ways to you</div>

You will build the things that are needed  
To cross over distance or time  
What you're getting or giving or who you've been missing  
Determines the speed and the line

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Am/C  
Am/G  
C/Am/F/C  
F/G  

Am/Em  
F/G  
F//Am/C  
F/G/C</div>
