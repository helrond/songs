There are times to get back to basics
And this is one of those
Food water air and love
And you, you alone

There are times when not much matters
And this is one of those
I could even throw my life away
For you, you alone

I'm happy being your lover
I'm fine with being your friend
But if there was just one thing that I could be
I'd want to be your home

I know that I'm your lover
I know I am your friend
But what I really want to know is
Am I your home
