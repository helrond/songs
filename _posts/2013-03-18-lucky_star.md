Run through the streets of Chinatown  
Get on a bus named after a sign  
With some luck all of the light  
Won't be gone by the time you arrive

So you've got friends in some other town  
Make it there fast as you can  
You've got a seat and you've got plans  
But everything else is out of your hands

<div class="chorus">
	And you know what it's going to take<br/>
	But you still hope that fortune and luck will go your way<br/>
	And you hope for space and you hope for speed<br/>
	Keep your desires from becoming your need
</div>

So you do the best you can  
Look for ways to beat the odds, improve your chances, pass the time  
But you know when you arrive  
Everyone will be drunk and already high

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
	G/C<br/>
	G/D<br/>
	G/C<br/>
	G/D/G<br/>
	<br/>
	C/G<br/>
	Em/Am/C/D<br/>
	C/G<br/>
	Em/C/D/G
