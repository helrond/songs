When I think about the scar just below your right wrist
And how you turned the tiller and the windward side would lift

<div class="chorus">You didn't talk too much of history or make too many plans
    You read the weather and the water and made some use out of them
    All the places that you traveled all the things that you have seen
    All the people that you've met, you could have been me</div>
