Wisdom cries aloud in the street  
Wisdom shouts in the market place  
From the walls she calls and she pleads  
At the gates screams out her name to those who hear

<div class="chorus">How long how long will you  
Delight in being just a fool  
How long how long will we  
Be deaf to those who see</div>

When light turns black blue sky to black  
The walls stand tall and you can't go back  
You will call no answer  
Look for me but I am gone

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Listen to me walk in the light  
Beg for knowledge plead for insight  
Love the Lord love the world  
Hope for life is life incurred

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
