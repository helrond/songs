What could I do  
I took you at your word  
Trying my best to belong  
What could I do  
What could I do  
I was wrong

What could I do  
I was not myself and  
Outnumbered five to one  
What could I do  
What could I do  
I was so gone

What could I do  
Being less than kind  
A lesson learned so well  
What could I do  
What could I do  
I was bored as hell

What could I do  
Without knowing my faults  
With no grounds for confidence  
What could I do  
What could I do  
I have no defense
