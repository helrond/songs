I've never known what to say about this
Is it love or gravity
And I've never known what to say about you
Is it mere proximity
But I know all too well
Life with you is war
The honeymoon is over
The hounds are barking at the door

I don't know whose orbit I'm in
A planet or a black hole
I don't know if I am more or less
A mountain or a gorge
But I know all too well
There'll be time for many things
Time to dwell in harmony
Time to live in sin

I don't know what to say about this
Is it love or persistence
And I don't know what to say about you
Are you mine or somebody else
