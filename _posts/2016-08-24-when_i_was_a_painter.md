When I was a painter I used both my hands  
Made my living on someone else's plans  
And the past was not a place of regrets  
When I was a painter, I was a happy man

When I was a painter, I didn't speak all day  
Let it out in songs, or some other way

Put yourself in position to draw a straight and a clean line

<div class="chorus">
  Stand back at the end of the day and you've got something to show for it<br/>
  Stand back at the end of the day and you've got nothing to owe of it
</div>
