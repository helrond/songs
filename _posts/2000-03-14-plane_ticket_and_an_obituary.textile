I don't need a plane ticket to fly
I don't need a mountain to reach the sky
I don't need an obituary
I don't need a river to reach the sea

How did you let your mind die
How did your eyes go blind
How did your fingers go numb
How did you pale under the sun

<div class="chorus">Everybody knows the signs
Nobody will be there sometimes
Nobody tries to die and
Everybody tries not to try</div>

I don't need a plane ticket to fly
I don't need a mountain to reach the sky
I don't need an obituary
I don't need a river to reach the sea
