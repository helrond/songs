Trouble went walking out of town and walked right to Virginia  
Sat down in a cell in correctional hell and tapped a shoulder with his finger  
Talked to the mind in a way that was kind and the boy couldn't stop him, he said  
Boy don't you want to be free, oh boy don't you want to be free

Inmates don't make the laws that send the congressmen to jail  
Beggars can't be choosers and justice never fails  
Did he hang, was he hung, did he do it, was it done - the dead can't answer  
Boy, don't you want to be free, oh boy don't you want to be free

Kill the lies and kill the law, kill all of those who saw  
Kill your heart and kill yourself, kill for your mental health  
Kill my heart and kill me, you can't kill what murder makes us be  
Boy, don't you want to be free, oh boy don't you want to be free

Trouble jumped ship and headed out west where he heard the days were longer  
Sat himself down in another part of town and started this all over  
It won't be long, he's just been gone, and the broken record plays again  
Boy, don't you want to be free, oh boy don't you want to be free
