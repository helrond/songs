They'll be lurking in the shadows every time you turn your back  
In wingtips and threepiece suits and spotless bowler hats  
And a whisper in the alley leads off the evening news  
Every word you've spoken being turned back on you

<div class="chorus">Something on you, something on you  
Somewhere there's a man watching your every move  
Something on you, something on you  
Somewhere there's a man who has something to lose</div>

They'll listen in to every call at any time of day  
They'll get it down on paper, they'll get it down on tape  
In a basement around the corner or a van just down the block  
There will be a recording every time you talk

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They'll shine it in your face, put your civil rights on hold  
Asking questions with answers they already know  
And if you spill your guts or play it close to the vest  
It will end up in a memo on the Director's desk

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">
Am/C//G  
F//C/G  
Am/C//G  
F//C/G  

F/C/Am/G  
F/C/Am/G  
F/C/Am/G  
F/C/G/C</div>
