It flew back via Paris with me  
And bought a cup of coffee, light and sweet  
I thought about the traces of my traveling  
About spending what was given to me

<div class="chorus">
  Every word you've left unspoken<br/>
  All you've bent and all you've broken<br/>
  Everything you've forgotten to do<br/>
  It comes back to you
</div>

He must have known how it would end  
For smashing people's gods is not a way of making friends  
And I don't mind the tale of roses, fire and fish  
If the story's told while someone's listening

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

He struck the dust with his heel  
Water streamed, the desert bore sunflowers and wheat  
Now the acqueducts stretch on for miles beside the road  
And the dams into the distance as far as I can see

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

There will come a day and it won't be long  
When things that now are permanent will be gone  
Empires crack and crumble, deserts turn to seas  
What I've given will come back in a song

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
