Hey little sister don't, don't let them do this to you  
Hey little sister don't, don't let them do this to you  
Those things you're believing are not real  
Don't let them do this to you

Hey little sister don't, don't believe what it tells you  
Hey little sister don't, don't believe what it tells you  
You are occupied territory  
Don't believe what it tells you

<div class="chorus">
  It is true that our bodies fail us<br/>
  And Lord, so do our minds<br/>
  But passing on all of the blame<br/>
  Is the worst kind of lie
</div>

Hey little sister don't, don't let them do this to you  
Hey little sister don't, don't let them do this to you  
Those things you're believing are not real  
Don't let them do this to you
