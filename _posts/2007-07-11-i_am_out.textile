I am out to write a song for everybody
For all who've been and all those yet to come
For everyone who's given up completely
I am out to sing a song for everyone

I am out to write a song for everybody
Who's seen their share of hard times and dreams
The rich, the poor, the losers and the winners
And everybody else in between

<div class="chorus">A song for every person, in every single land
For all of those personalities
For every single city, and every single town
It's a song just for me</div>

I am out to write a song for every season
I am out to write a song for every day
For the ghettos, the suburbs and the country
For the places and names that never change

I am out to write a song for every country
For every planet, every single sun
And it will be like I believe, like I belong
I am out to write this universe a song

<div class="chorus">A song for every person, in every single land
For all of those personalities
For every single city, and every single town
It's a song just for me</div>
