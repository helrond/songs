What did you come in living for what do you go out dying for  
It's not this  
What did you start out praying for what do you end up craving more  
It's not this

<div class="chorus">
  Say you want to fly away<br/>
  Say you want to burn all this<br/>
  Say you want to go astray<br/>
  You're stuck in bliss
</div>

Love turns to hell when there's nothing missing  
It's not this  
There's no one to talk to when everyone's listening  
It's not this

<div class="chorus">
  One day when it all comes falling down<br/>
  And you look up to see the higher ground<br/>
  You'll know you've never been there before<br/>
  And your heaven is hell and your living won't sell<br/>
  You a ticket to get through the golden door<br/>
  <br/>
  CHORUS
</div>

A dream turns to a nightmare when it keeps repeating  
It's not this  
And even best gestures can't be anything but fleeting  
It's not this

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Don't live for this, don't die for this you that something better exists  
It's not this  
Don't pray for this, don't crave for this your life is worth more than bliss  
It's not this

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  Em<br/>
  <br/>
  Em/G/D/C<br/>
  <br/>
  Em/D
</div>
