When I stepped into the rain on that cold November night  
My hands were in my pockets, my eyes were quick and bright  
You're a sailor said the Englishman, but Lord what's in your pants  
Oh, I know it's not ants  
I did not reply, for I knew what was said  
That the captains of industry heard every word  
But I've been busted and battered man, I have been abused  
I'm mystified and confused  

<div class="chorus">
  So I asked him who devised this game, who shot the sheriff, who was to blame<br/>
  He said what you have heard is true they'll crucify you<br/>
  On Railroad Avenue

She was thinking of the captain as she put on her face  
But Smiling Jenny knew the admiral was lying in wait  
She was moaning for a reason to strengthen her will  
For a sailor down in Mobile  
She turned from her mirror as I walked in  
Said I to Jenny, I don't like the way you grin  
Oh sonny boy you've got a lot to learn  
She said while my conscience burned

<div class="chorus">
  How high's the water, momma, where is the past, well it's five feet high and rising fast<br/>
  Say one more word my boy and they will bury you<br/>
  On Railroad Avenue
</div>

Mother Mary, said the ladybug, I'm flying from home  
There's a coroner's convention down in San Antone  
A shot of compassion to free me of my sins  
Half a year, a fifth of gin

I've got mouths to feed I've got bills to pay  
Said the train conductor as he walked away  
Who's that stirring who's in my bed  
I thought you were cold and dead

<div class="chorus">
  Call me the jester, call me the maid, call John Henry back from the grave<br/>
  You can find all that you need but not one single grain of truth<br/>
  On Railroad Avenue<br/>
  Call me a liar, call me a fool, a double agent, the hope of youth<br/>
  You could get picked up, t-boned, curled, turn black and blue<br/>
  On Railroad Avenue
