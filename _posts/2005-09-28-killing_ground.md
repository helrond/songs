Started out when the leaves were changing  
Blood on the railroad tracks  
Started out, man I was not stopping  
I held a rifle in my hand

All the way through Mingo County  
Hound dogs are set on me  
My face posted from here to Texas  
Felts' goon squad at my heels

<div class="chorus">
  And the law it brings you down<br/>
  And the law kicks you around<br/>
  And the law it busts this union town<br/>
  On this killing ground
</div>

I have been too brave, too frightened  
I have lost, I have found  
Now this town is burned to cinders  
My home made a killing ground

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Started out when the leaves were falling  
Aching heart and itching hand  
Started out, man I won't be stopping  
Until we've reached the Promised Land

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  Fdim/C/G/Am<br/>
  <br/>
  F//G//C/G/Am
</div>
