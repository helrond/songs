Build me a home in the rocks and the stones  
On a mountain high  
So I can watch this world pass on by  
Build me a home  
Build me a home

Build me a home without walls or doors  
Windows or stairs  
Let all who enter be no strangers there  
Build me a home  
Build me a home

Build me a home of memories and poems  
Recipes and dreams  
And all my friends who can hear the harmonies  
Build me a home  
Build me a home

<div class="chorus">BRIDGE</div>

Build me a home in the rocks and the stones  
On a mountain high  
So I can watch this world pass on by  
Build me a home  
Build me a home
