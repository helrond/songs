What did you  
Come out to see  
A man with a tongue like the wind  
A resurrection  

Ash in wind  
Bullets in the debris  
Will the future appear as the past  
Are we bound to repeat

<div class="chorus">
  The longing of a fair maiden behind moat protected walls<br/>
  The prayers rising to heaven as evening shadows fall
</div>

Home from war  
Wounded soldier walks  
In what is done and what is seen  
Forgotten how to talk

<div class="chorus">
  And what do those who are left behind do when their loved ones come home<br/>
  Is there more than a smile or a kiss or a hastily muttered hello
</div>

There’s no harm  
In telling tales of war  
But the future cannot be the past  
Bathed in blood and gore

To all those  
Who at the tomb now stand  
Rise up and walk like Lazarus  
Take up your cross and dance

<div class="chorus">
  And the ghosts that haunt this land are that and no more<br/>
  The lives that now are lived are worthy of those before
</div>

Dare to dream  
Endure memory  
Do you have courage to create  
Or just destroy

<div class="chorus">
  I know you’re not my saviour because mine has wounded hands<br/>
  I know you’re not the one to be led to slaughter like the lambs
</div>

What did you  
Come out to see  
A man with a body covered in scars  
A walking miracle
