Back home in Tennessee life was pretty plain  
I'd milk the cows and feed the chickens give the horse some hay  
Ma cooked dinner on the stove with logs that I would split  
No TV, no telephones no place you couldn't spit

It's true I miss my mother my farm my family  
But the thing I remember most is where we'd go to pee  
There was a shack out in the backyard with a half moon on the door  
It was dark and it was hard to see what you were shooting for

<div class="chorus">
  Pissing in the dark, pissing in the dark<br/>
  I can't see my hands and I can't see my shoes<br/>
  Pissing in the dark, pissing in the dark<br/>
  Lord, won't you guide me, tell me where to shoot
</div>

My father was a gambler and he spent his last dime  
On a fifth of gutrot whiskey to distract his worried mind  
And when the police found him below the steeple of St. Marks  
He had his pants around his ankles he was pissing in the dark

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Now I'm standing here in Basrah in the middle of the night  
A smoking gun in my left hand a grenade in my right  
And I screamed at my commander as the bullets 'round us barked  
This ain't a good war anymore we're pissing in the dark

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  G/C/G<br/>
  C/G/D/D7<br/>
  G/C/G<br/>
  C/G/D/G
</div>
