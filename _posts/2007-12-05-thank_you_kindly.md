For everyone who's trusted every word  
For those who don't believe a thing they've heard  
For everyone who stayed at home and all those who kept moving on  
I sat down and wrote them this song

<div class="chorus">
  And I will thank you kindly<br />
  Thank you kindly<br />
  Thank you kindly my friends
</div>

For everyone who values what they owe  
For those who have got no soul  
For everyone who'd die for it and those who just don't give a shit  
Without you I am nothing at all

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

For everyone who left me alone  
And those who took me as one of their own  
Who opened wide their hearts and homes, a place to stay where I roamed  
Without you I am wondering still

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

For everyone who is all I want to be  
For those who are living out my fears  
Those who hit the harmonies and those who can't find the key  
I could not sing without you

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

For everyone sure of where they're going  
For those who have forgotten all they know  
For those too serious to smile and those who laugh so hard they cry  
You have taught me everything I know

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  G/D<br />
  C/D<br />
  G/Am<br />
  C/D<br />
  <br />
  G/C/G/D
</div>
