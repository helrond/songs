<div class="chorus">
  No I don't sleep<br/>
  No I am not dead<br/>
  No I will never leave you<br/>
  I'll be with you instead<br/>
  <br/>
  Don't be afraid<br/>
  I am with you, just like I said<br/>
  Don't cry and mourn<br/>
  I guide you, don't be forlorn
</div>

I'm in the breeze that ripples the grass  
I'm in the leaves as they float past  
I'm in the autumn's russet and brown  
I am with you and I'll never let you down

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I'm in the small stream's song  
As it frolics along  
In the wind that ruffles your hair  
I am with you, I will always be there

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
