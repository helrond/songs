<div class="chorus">No I don't sleep  
No I am not dead  
No I will never leave you  
I'll be with you instead

Don't be afraid  
I am with you, just like I said  
Don't cry and mourn  
I guide you, don't be forlorn</div>

I'm in the breeze that ripples the grass  
I'm in the leaves as they float past  
I'm in the autumn's russet and brown  
I am with you and I'll never let you down

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I'm in the small stream's song  
As it frolics along  
In the wind that ruffles your hair  
I am with you, I will always be there

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
