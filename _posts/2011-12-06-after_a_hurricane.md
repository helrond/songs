<div class="notes">for Albertville</div>

There were limbs down everywhere and those trees ain't coming back  
And people without power three weeks after the fact  
And on Sunday when it ripped through town howling like a train  
You closed your eyes and waited til you only heard the rain

<div class="chorus">You will have to think twice about where to turn that wheel  
You will have to get used to the way things look from here  
Because nothing you know will ever be the same  
After a hurricane</div>

After it was over, when all the lights were out  
You made your way down to the road to drive back into town  
Well they closed down the highway; cops were turning folks around  
And a line was coming down between then and now

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The governor declared a state and called out the Guard  
And the President dropped by to let us know we would survive  
But we sweated out that summer in the Alabama sun  
Unemployed and with no way to pay for what must be done

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/F  
C/F/G  
C/F  
C/G/C  

Am/C/F/G  
Am/C/F/G  
Am/C/F/C  
F/G/C</div>
