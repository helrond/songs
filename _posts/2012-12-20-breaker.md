On the edge of the city the air is thick with smoke  
And it's there they drag the rusting hull of ships up on the shore

<div class="chorus">
  The world is full of people who are building and making do<br/>
  But someone has to break things down, someone's got to make some room<br/>
  And someone's got to make something old out of the new<br/>
  Tear apart the present to give the future forms and possibilities
</div>

Dreams

I am stronger than iron and older than sand  
I can tear down anything built by human hands

<div class="chorus">
  Broke down<br/>
  What kind of life is that to live<br/>
  Broke down<br/>
  Just how much more have I got to give
</div>

Ship breaker

When your course is run  
I will be waiting for you
