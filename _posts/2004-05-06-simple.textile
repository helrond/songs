It's easy to say that I know nothing at all
And what I see may all of it be false
It's easy to say that one and one is undefined
But all we have to do each day is simply live this life

It's easy to say you are the master of this plan
And what you hold so dear is in your hand
It's easy to say this is a miracle divine
Because all we have to do each day is simply live this life

I've tried to keep this short and sweet
But the words keep flowing out of me
It's such a mystery

I've tried to slip my trembling grip
But I love this life too muchv
Just like Odysseus

I could be raised up
Like I was Lazarusv

I've tried to keep this lecture brief

Enter into life
I am a simple man

I know it's easy to say you believe in anything
It's simpler still to just refuse
