Someday soon and it won't be long now  
Someday soon and it won't be long  
I'll shake these bones and clap these hands all the way to glory land  
Someday soon and it won't be long

Someday soon and it won't be long now  
Someday soon and it won't be long  
Every thing will be revealed, there'll be no sickness or disease  
Someday soon and it won't be long

Someday soon and it won't be long now  
Someday soon and it won't be long  
Every language, every sun, every color become one  
Someday soon and it won't be long

Someday soon and it won't be long now  
Someday soon and it won't be long  
Time will bend and shift like sand, the waves be quieted to land  
Someday soon and it won't be long
