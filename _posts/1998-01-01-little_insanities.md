Hello I'm crazy how are you  
Got locked in and I can't leave the zoo  
Hello my mind is out of sight  
Another ball is dropped and broken into night

<div class="chorus">
  If this really is<br/>
  The land of the free<br/>
  Why are you tied to<br/>
  Your SUV
</div>

Am I the only one who's got  
A warning on my cup contents are hot  
Am I the only one who missed  
The warnings on our instruments of death

<div class="chorus">
  If this really is<br/>
  The home of the brave<br/>
  Why the hell<br/>
  Are we so afraid
</div>

We are so set on nuclear domination  
We have no idea that we have a case of mental constipation  
I want to know if all the shit we've got  
Is really worth defending

<div class="chorus">
  Quiet desperation<br/>
  Shopping cart hell<br/>
  Quiet desecration<br/>
  By a five star general
</div>

The scales of justice are permanently fixed  
To keep the poor brown people permanently jinxed  
Line up step right, don't cross the line  
Do as you're told and you'll do just fine

<div class="chorus">
  Who let the tiger<br/>
  Out of the zoo<br/>
  Could it be so<br/>
  Maybe you're crazy too
</div>
<div class="chords">
