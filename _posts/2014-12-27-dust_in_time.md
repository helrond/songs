Everything becomes a ruin  
Every place is already a ruin

A city or a mountain will both end up as dust in time.

Ruins of nature

Two ways water can kill you in the desert: thirst or drowning

Angles of geology  
Roots of the mountains  
Scars  
Veins

Distinguishing the human from the natural  
The effects of nature on civilization
