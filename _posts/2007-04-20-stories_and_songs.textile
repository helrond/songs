Counting water towers from the back seat of a car
Playing Take It to the Limit, it was 1984
Colors and numbers, her ABCs
But the things that she learned were more than any of these

<div class="chorus">Lessons learned in stories and songs
Ways to take your mind off of what's going wrong
How to begin all over again
Who else could teach us all of these things</div>

They would hang on her every word
Of deserts and jungles and the animal world
And while she taught them to count past ten
They learned that failure is just giving in

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When she sang it was never alone
Her voice blew darkness right out of this home
Keeping the tempo, staying in key
We learned how to live in harmony

How to live with mistakes you have made
Ways to trick the monster out from under your bed
How to behave like a human being
These are the things that my mother taught me

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
