Here
I look to find you
There 
And here and back again

Where 
Were you when she breathed her last
How
Could you tell me it's worth what's past

Is there another way to show what it's like to die so slow
Is there another way to see this price of being free

<div class="chorus">Meet me halfway to Baghdad
Meet me halfway where the ocean meets the sky
Meet me halfway to Baghdad
Meet me halfway to the tears I have to cry</div>

Where
Were you when heaven rained fire
Why 
Does the truth just stoke the fire

Give yourself a chance to take more than a glance
Give yourself the peace to know you're not asleep

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

If
I gave you the chance to go and see
Would 
You finally hear me

Your churches have no windows, but our graveyards have eyes
Your churches have no windows, but our gravestones don't lie

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
