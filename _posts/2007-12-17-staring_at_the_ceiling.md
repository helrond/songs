Staring at the ceiling it's a wonder it don't fall  
As if that were some comfort at all  
Thinking of the future I am worried all the time  
The weather, water and the signs

<div class="chorus">
  The world keeps turning round releasing fears<br />
  Direction fades and motion disappears<br />
  We go laughing on to the end<br />
  Pushing past the last threshold of time<br />
  Turning all our failures into shrines<br />
  Inheritance known as a gift
</div>

Standing on the mountain and you're praying it would burn  
For some mercy in return  
Kneeling by the river you've been begging for rain  
That all might be forgiven again

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Shouting at the sky like you can bring it down  
And there would be some higher ground  
Dimes in the fountain yeah you threw it all away  
In words destined to fade

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
  Em/G/D/Em<br />
  C/G/D<br />
  <br />
  Am/G<br />
  Am/G<br />
  Am/G/D
</div>
