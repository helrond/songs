Take what you can carry  
Leave the rest behind  
There's no sense to even worry  
Age is nothing but time

<div class="chorus">Permanence is fiction  
You must spend what you save  
I have learned no convictions  
It will all pass away</div>

I am a keeper  
Arranging hope  
In the currency of paper  
A dealer gone broke

<div class="chorus">CHORUS

When you write it down  
Please remember me  
Every line and phrase  
Is a mystery</div>

If all of my savings  
Outweighed the cost  
The interest gathered  
Served to save the lost

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Take what you can carry  
Leave the rest behind  
There's no sense to even worry  
Age is nothing but time
