Take what you can carry  
Leave the rest behind  
There's no sense to even worry  
Age is nothing but time

<div class="chorus">
  Permanence is a fiction<br />
  You must spend what you save<br />
  I have learned no convictions<br />
  It will all pass away
</div>

I am a keeper  
Arranging hope  
In the currency of paper  
A dealer gone broke

<div class="chorus">
  CHORUS<br />
  <br />
  When you write it down<br />
  Please remember me<br />
  Every line and phrase<br />
  Is a mystery
</div>

If all of my savings  
Outweighed the cost  
The interest gathered  
Served to save the lost

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Take what you can carry  
Leave the rest behind  
There's no sense to even worry  
Age is nothing but time
