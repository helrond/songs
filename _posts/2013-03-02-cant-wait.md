I have always wanted to see  
Angels in the branches of a tree  
Hear a voice speaking to me  
From somewhere I can't see

I believed in certainty  
That would never fade, much less disappear  
Thought that I would know for sure  
And the harder I listened, the less I heard

<div class="chorus">I can't wait anymore for it to come to me  
I can't say anymore it's not how I want it to be</div>

I have been waiting to be moved  
To know what it is that I am meant to do  
But I've discovered lately where I stand  
And the farther back I step the closer I am

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
G/Em/C/D  

C/G/D/G  
C/G/C/D/G
</div>
