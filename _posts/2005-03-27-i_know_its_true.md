I know the sun is shining somewhere  
I know tomorrow's never far away  
I know the skies are blue in Boston  
But New York City is cold and gray

<div class="chorus">I know it's true (fact is stranger than fiction)  
I know it's true (the amazing things I've heard)  
I know it's true (we have exceeded all prediction)  
I know it's true (this is a beautiful world)</div>

I know I'm going to quit this drinking  
I know my life is going to make some sense
-
I know I am still innocent

I know I can rely on happy endings  
You play Romeo, I'll be Juliet

I know that we have nothing but this moment  
But right now sucks and tomorrow probably will

Did you know slugs have 4 noses  
Goldfish have ADD  
That camels have 3 eyelids  
Fish cough like you and me
