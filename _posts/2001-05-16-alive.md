I left you alone  
I left you cold  
I left you dead  
I left you with a hole in your head  
I left you with a piece of lead  
I left you in the lake you bled  
I left you with your hand on the phone  
I left you all alone

You give me life  
You give me peace  
You give me blood  
You give release  
You made me laugh  
You made me cry  
I made you scream  
I made you die  
I made you beg  
I waved goodbye

<div class="chorus">
  You won’t find me on the highway<br/>
  Going 65<br/>
  Everything is going my way<br/>
  I’m alive<br/>
  <br/>
  I know my dad would be proud of me<br/>
  I know my mom still loves me<br/>
  I know that you won’t feel a thing<br/>
  A know the way that blood can sing<br/>
  <br/>
  Don’t look over your shoulder<br/>
  Keep your eyes on the road ahead<br/>
  By the time you see me<br/>
  You’ll already be dead<br/>
  <br/>
  Life’s too short to be nobody<br/>
  <br/>
  Life’s too short not to die<br/>
  <br/>
  When I was young
</div>

Are you after me  
Are you after you  
Are you after my life  
Are you after yours too  
Are you after my mind  
Are you after my head  
Are you after my thoughts  
And the books I have read  
I am after you  
I am after me  
I am after your blood  
I am after your plea  
I am after your home  
I am after your life  
I am after your kid  
I am after your wife

I am after fame  
I am after TV  
I am after success  
I want to be seen  
I am after faith  
I am after hope  
I am after love  
I am after dope
