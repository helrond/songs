Did it start when the pilgrims landed  
Was it somewhere in those early days  
Has it come lately upon us  
Did it start when they shot JFK

Was it saving the natives from their culture  
Was it speaking softly and carrying a big stick  
Was it saving the Germans from Hitler  
Was it rescuing the world from the communist's grip

<div class="chorus">When did we get the high ground  
Does the world need a savior from itself  
When did we get the high ground  
Who will save us from ourselves</div>

Did it belong to England  
Did they once put on these airs  
Has it been ours forever  
Did the Russians once think it was theirs

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

And how do we keep it  
Do we kill more people than everyone else  
Long as we don't lose it  
I guess it won't hurt to protect ourselves

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
