Went to see a master of his craft
His vision of the future looked a lot like the past
He had the feeling and he knew the way

Outside of the fortress walls
A man was peddling blonde-haired dolls
Walking by I heard him say

<div class="chorus">
	China aa gaya hai
	China chah gaya hai
</div>

In Glamour Heights the artist smokes
And draws the sounds on the radio
I am not responsible, he said, anyway

I walked in on the pimp and his johns
In the mansion where he was born, he said
Come on in my friend, you've come from so far away

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When I climbed up the minaret stairs
And I saw the city from there
I'd never felt that feeling before

You shook my hand and welcomed me in
Asked me when I would come again
I was conquered then, Lahore

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
	Am/G

	Am
	F
	G/Am/G

	C/F/F/C/G
	C/F/F/C/G
</div>
