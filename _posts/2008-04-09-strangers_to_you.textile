You were drifting, you were blown
You were out there on your own
Riding lonely through the dust
Red rock canyons, wind and rust

You were lost in those stories told
Purple sage and desert gold
In the lamplight your heroes shone
Past midnight they went on and on

<div class="chorus">Without fear without pride making honor your guide
You rode off to that long sunrise
Everybody that came they called you by name
None were strangers, strangers to you</div>

You were justice served complete
Judge and jury, rope and steel
Always cautious with your trust
Shooting only when you must

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Knew the thirst and felt the freeze
And you struggled just to breathe
First man in and the last one out
None could fit into your coat

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">F/C/F/C
