Believe me  
I wanted to find it in people  
Believe me I tried  
Believe me  
I wanted to trust in the interest  
In payment for my time

<div class="chorus">
  Disappointed<br />
  Disappointed again
</div>

Believe me  
I wanted to keep it together  
Polite and cool  
Believe me  
I wanted to stay in control  
Rely on the rules

<div class="chorus">
  Disappointed<br />
  Disappointed again
</div>

Believe me  
I wanted to make it through  
Without ugliness  
Believe me  
I wanted to stand above it  
Do better than this

<div class="chorus">
  Disappointed<br />
  Disappointed again
</div>
