There were people in the past who thought about thir children's children
Planted flowers in the desert and called that heaven
These days we're building monuments to things the way we knew them
And giving up our parents to hospitals and coffins

<div class="chorus">What are we building when we break the soil
What is it made of and who does it employ
What is cherished, what is leveld, what is worn
What are we building, what are we building for</div>

These days I'm learning where to lean and how to amplify the motion
For time shapes every space and grains of sand hold up the ocean
The things that we have built will go on living their own lives
Our lives are made of moments, only moments are our lives



Building for time/use
Building on, in, of

detail is what happens to space over time
detail is the deposits of memory
an interface for nature

Some things I have had were broken long before I used them
Like they were made to crack or warp or bend
