There were people in the past who thought about thir children's children
Planted flowers in the desert and called that heaven
These days we're building monuments to things the way we knew them
And giving up our parents to hospitals and coffins

<div class="chorus">What are we building when we break the soil
What is it made of and who does it employ
What is cherished, what is leveld, what is worn
What are we building, who are we building for</div>

I'm reminded of a tree each time I think of forgetting
How it stood beside those graves with only silence as a blessing
And concrete stains and tangled vines, the light coming down
Remind me of thigs I thought were not to be found

Start with a triangle, a circle or a square
Let the craft of wind and weather take it from there
Carving out the details with the passage of time
A placce to put your memories, to lay down your mind

Now I'm learning where to lean and how to amplify the motion
For time shapes every space and grains of sand hold up the ocean
The things that we have built will go on living until they die
Our lives are made of moments, only moments are our lives
