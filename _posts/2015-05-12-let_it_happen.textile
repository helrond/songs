She said Karachi's broke my heart
It will happen to you

But by then it was too late

Dil Phaink

<div class="chorus">
	Let's throw it against the wall, see if it will fall
	See just how much more it can take
	Let's give it all away, pyaar honay dey
	Just let it happen and see what it will make
</div>

<div class="chords">
