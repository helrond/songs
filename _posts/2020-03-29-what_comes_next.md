Do you only cry for no good reason  
Do you only cry because you care  
Do you only cry out that you're leaving  
To show you're there

Do you only break out past the limit  
Do you only break upon the sand  
Do you only break down when you feel it  
Slipping from your hand

<div class="chorus">
  I can feel things are changing<br/>
  But I do not know the effects<br/>
  I can feel I have changed<br/>
  But I donâ€™t know what comes next
</div>

Do you only turn to take the measure  
Do you only turn against the tide  
Do you only turn in the right weather  
Season and time

Do you only stop yourself believing  
Do you only stop to take that call  
Do you only stop when it starts feeling  
Impossible

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chorus">
  All of their lives<br/>
  All the hearts they have moved<br/>
  They have burned so bright<br/>
  I don't know what to do
</div>

Do you only rise out of the morning  
Do you only rise against your own  
Do you only rise up without warning  
Like going home

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
