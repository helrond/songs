Do you only play when you are shorted  
Do you only deal with a full hand  
Do you only deal for all the marbles  
For a grand

Do you only try for no good reason  
Do you only shine because you care  
Do you only shine out in your season  
To show you're there

Do you only break up past the limit  
Do you only break upon the sand  
Do you only break down when you feel it  
Slipping from your hand

Do you only turn  
Do you only turn against the tide  
Do you only turn in the right weather  
The season and time

Do you only move on this like clockwork  
Do you only move up when you're short  
Do you only move when nothing else works  
As the last resort

Do you always move on when it's over  
~ ~ ~  
Do you ever look over your shoulder  
~ ~ ~  

Like going home  

in the morning  
without warning  

the other side of the door  

<div class="chorus">
  I can feel when things are changing<br/>
  But I do not know the effects<br/>
  I can feel that I have changed<br/>
  But I donâ€™t know what comes next
</div>
