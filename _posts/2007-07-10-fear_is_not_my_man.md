There was glass everywhere when she came down the stairs  
And she got on her knees in the yard  
And she cleaned up that place with a Colt .38  
Stuck in the small of her back

<div class="chorus">No man could compare to her  
In heart or hand  
I don't need no champion she said  
Fear is not my man, no,  
Fear is not my man</div>

Was a May afternoon when that whistle blew  
And he died in the factory blast  
She raised two Jimmy Deans and a homecoming queen  
All on her own

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When she came to me it was not out of need  
But a land of plenty and faith  
No small kind of love and no stars far above  
Would ever guide her feet

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
