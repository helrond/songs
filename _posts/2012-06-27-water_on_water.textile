Took a ride with the Monday morning blues
Up the Hudson on a rainy day
And I was thinking about you
And the way that things have changed

And I drifted up the river
Chasing dead leaves and the tide
I was thinking about her
And the way that history changes overnight

<div class="chorus">Just like water on water
We crash into each other
And leave no mark behind
On the rising tide</div>

And I asked myself that day
If I was running for a train that had already left
Or was I keeping the faith
Trying to believe in things unsaid
