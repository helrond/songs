Took a ride with the Monday morning blues
Up the Hudson on a rainy day
And I was thinking about you
And the way that things have changed

And I drifted up the bank
With the dead leaves and the tide
I was thinking about her
And how nothing ever happens overnight

<div class="chorus">Just like water on water
We crash into each other
And leave no mark behind
On the rising tide</div>

And I walked along the edge
Where optimism meets despair
Thought of promises I'd made
How things get pushed beyond repair
