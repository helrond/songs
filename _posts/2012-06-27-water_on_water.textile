Took a ride with the Monday morning blues
Up the Hudson on a rainy day
And I was thinking about you
And the way that things have changed

<div class="chorus">Just like water on water
We crash into each other
And leave no mark behind
On the rising tide</div>

As I followed the tide, chasing dead leaves and styrofoam cups
