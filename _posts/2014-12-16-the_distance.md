It was the summer of dreams, they were dancing in the field  
And thinking that the future was full of possibilities  
Now they're miles past those years, those guitars and jeans  
They've taken to preaching and growing out their beards

They were just kids in school, doing things that kids will do  
Not looking to be a number leading the news  
But those faces on the page were all blurred or turned away  
Like getting out alive was to be ashamed

<div class="chorus">
	And the distance, oh the distance<br/>
	It stretches out before me, other lands and other lives<br/>
	In the distance, oh the distance<br/>
	Can I make more of your life without making less of mine?
</div>

We stood in different lines, you had yours and I had mine  
As if the color of our passports made us of two different kinds  
And I was led right through the door, like a million times before  
Wondering if you were less or I had more

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Man I wonder about this world, about the things we've seen and heard  
If we're lying to ourselves about the debts that we've incurred  
And if a nation can be only geography  
If edges were not destined to bleed

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
	E/A/E<br/>
	E/B<br/>
	E/A/E<br/>
	E/B/E<br/>
	<br/>
	A/E<br/>
	E/B<br/>
	E/A<br/>
	A/E/B/E
</div>
