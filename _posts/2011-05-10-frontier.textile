Where I stood there was water as far as I could see
It was not the ocean but man it could have been
And I was thinking of the places where the horizon curls
Riverbeds and cities named after saints and girls

<div class="chorus">I want to stand at the border
In a place where they don't know me
I want to make it on the frontier
Where I can let it out and let it be</div>

I climbed up the hill and left my stones in a heap
One by one I  brought them there to lift up the peak
And I was thinking of the essence, I was thinking of the cost
Thinking of finding one more way to get lost

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

As a boy a dreamt of riding out on the western plains
Now I pass through turnstiles almost every single day
And at every border crossing you'll find these questions there
Where you've been, who you met, if you have something to declare

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/Em/D/G
G/Em/C/D
G/Em/D/G
G/Em/D/G
