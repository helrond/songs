At 4 am it's time to fly  
Put on your coat but leave this suitcase standing by  
Let these possessions pass you by  
You'll never need them in the sweet bye and bye

No time to pack your life away  
One chance is all you get, at least that's what they say  
More than throwing it away  
You'll never need it in the place you're going to stay

<div class="chorus">And out of here he'll fly  
Out of the weight of darkness fallen from his mind  
And out of here he'll fly  
Upward past the little hells he has left behind</div>

Onwards, upwards pushing in  
All the lives that haunt him still won't let him in  
Another way to start again  
Another life to live to show us what has been

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

No destinations to approach  
Maybe he'll pass beyond the ends of this rope  
Beneath the arching leaves of hope  
Will lean to rest and hear the sweet sound below

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
Em / Cadd9 / Dsus2  
Em / Cadd9 / Bdim7  

Em / G / Cadd9  
Em / G / D</div>
