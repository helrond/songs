<div class="notes">Title stolen from Chris Brown</div>

I was stretched out completely, I was at my breaking point  
I had given up on running or getting out of this joint  
Just looking for a way to profit from my loss  
I was in the desert, but I thought I was on the cross

The heat was so intense it was impossible to think  
And it hurt to move and even more to drink  
Waiting for an angel to stand by my side  
I was in the desert, but I thought I was in the fire

The darkness was so thick you could cut it with a knife  
And I cursed my luck and the story of my life  
I was hoping that righteousness would go my bail  
I was in the desert, but I thought I was in the whale

The wind whipped past my ears and salt was in my nose  
I drifted further from the shore no matter how hard I rowed  
Wishing I could walk on water, know how full my nets might be  
I was in the desert, but I thought I was on the sea
