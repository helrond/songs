<div class="notes">
	Inspired by http://dp.la/item/febadeab32df38308ab67e4486eade2f
</div>

It was a picture of a picture on a screen
Of something that might have been
A print from a foot from an ape
An enigma, a legend, a fake

<div class="chorus">
	What did you see, what did you see
	When did things start happening
	What did you see, could it be
	You were just imagining
</div>

To some it was as solid as a wall
And to others it was nothing at all
A rope or 																																				a fan were only clues
Meanwhile the elephant was not amused

Some people see legitimate force
And others a betrayal of the law
The bullet, the badge and the gun
An accident or the norm
