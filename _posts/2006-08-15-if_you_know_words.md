From the time that she was young  
You could hear her singing that song  
Says it was God that taught her heart  
She just had to stick to her part

She sang with a voice all her own  
Keeping the faith and passing it on  
The good and bad times, the major, minor keys  
Change the words, but keep this melody

<div class="chorus">And if you know the words, then go ahead and sing it  
If you know the truth, then go ahead and live it  
Even if your voice is the only thing you own  
You've got more than enough 'cause you've still got a song</div>

And on the day they lay her down  
To rise up to glory and that heavenly crown  
Still have a song on her lips, in her heart  
Still will be happy just to do her part

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Let me keep on singing the songs that I know  
Even if no one is listening, let me still carry on  
Not for fortune, glory or fame  
But just to keep on living and remembering my name

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
