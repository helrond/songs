You are a liar  
When you turned to me and said  
Turned to me and said

Here it is; my desire  
In shades of blue and green and red  
Blue and green and red

<div class="chorus">
  If I knew what you would find<br/>
  In the eyes of my own mind<br/>
  I would have been so much less kind<br/>
  My camera
</div>

You are much wiser  
Than you have any right to be  
Any right to be

Back then things were brighter  
And they came on easily  
Came on easily

<div class="chorus">
  When I saw what could be blamed<br/>
  On the light and on the frame<br/>
  I should have dropped you without shame<br/>
  My camera
</div>

You are a reminder  
Of the desert and the sea  
The mountains and the streams

After this what you require  
Is nothing that you need  
Nothing that you need

<div class="chorus">
  If we've looked and disagreed<br/>
  On the way things go from here<br/>
  You have always been sincere<br/>
  My camera
</div>
