Three more days of dust and glory to rid myself of the angel's story  
Before I'm thrust to the breaking point before I'm trusted to heal and anoint  
Three more days of blood and thunder to sanctify this rape and plunder  
To protect your firstborn son to find a target for your gun

<div class="chorus">The world has burned a thousand times and frozen over too  
And I suspect our death won't be by knife or wire  
We'll go down this time by friendly fire</div>

Three more days to find a savior to find a lover who can raise her  
All that you've cast before the swine, all that is laid before these feet of mine  
Three more days to turn the mountains into dust and crystal fountains  
The blind to see the lame to dance fate cry out to circumstance

<div class="chorus">The world has burned a thousand times and frozen over too  
And I suspect our death won't be by knife or wire  
We'll go down this time by friendly fire  

You say burn baby burn burn baby baby burn  
Hell is on the local line  
You say burn baby burn burn baby baby burn  
Nothing's changed this time</div>

Three more days to suffer treason at the hand of fickle reason  
To suffer all that's left to hate to be cursed by all degenerates  
Three more days to die completely to all that will defeat you  
To come unfettered to the well to be freed from the deadly spell

<div class="chorus">The world has burned a thousand times and frozen over too  
And I suspect our death won't be by knife or wire  
We'll go down this time by friendly fire  

You say burn baby burn burn baby baby burn  
But there's water everywhere  
You say burn baby burn burn baby baby burn  
And you're consumed by the white whale</div>
