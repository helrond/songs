Believe me
I wanted to find it in people
Believe me I tried
Believe me
I wanted to trust in the interest
In payment for my time

<div class="chorus">Disappointed
Disappointed again</div>

Believe me
I wanted to keep it together
Polite and cool
Believe me
I wanted to stay in control
Rely on the rules

<div class="chorus">Disappointed
Disappointed again</div>

Believe me
I wanted to make it through
Without ugliness
Believe me
I wanted to stand above it
Do better than this

<div class="chorus">Disappointed
Disappointed again</div>
