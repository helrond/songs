Standing on the platform waiting for the flood
Waiting for anything that would be enough
I hold my head up

With a choice I'll take the window seat
I'll turn my head and hold my peace
And I will hang my coat up
<div class="chorus">I tell myself it's honest work
    Tell myself I'm doing it for you 
    But you I have not seen in quite some time</div>

...
...
...
<div class="chorus">Cigarette smoke and coffee stains
    These are the things that I call home
    And home I have not been in quite some time</div>

Down the street there's a vacant man
He makes more money than the Taliban
And I losing my cool
<div class="chorus">In this city where it never rains
    And we are always at war
    And war is a place that's hard to find</div>



<div class="chords">Em
