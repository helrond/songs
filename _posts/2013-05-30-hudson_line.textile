Arriving early for a window seat
I turn my head and seldom speak
I hang my coat up

Waiting on the platform

This city where it rains every afternoon
And we are always at war

<div class="chorus">I tell myself it's honest work
Tell myself I'm doing it for you
But you I have not seen in quite some time</div>


<div class="chorus">Cigarette smoke and coffee stains
These are the things that I call home
And there I have not been in quite some time</div>


<div class="chords">Em
C
Em/C

C
G/D
D/Em</div>
