Arriving early for a window seat
I turn my head and never speak
I hang my coat up

Waiting on the platform

I tell myself it's honest work
Tell myself I'm doing it for you
But you I have not seen in quite some time

Cigarette smoke and coffee stains
These are the things that I call home
And there I have not been in quite some time
