Standing on the platform waiting for the flood
Waiting for anything that would be enough
I hold my head up

With a choice I'll take the window seat
I'll turn my head and hold my peace
And I will hang my coat up
<div class="chorus">I tell myself it's honest work
    Tell myself I'm doing it for you 
    But you I have not seen in quite some time</div>

The express train has the right of way
And it's not like I have much to say
To you anymore

The local gets more and more delayed
The further it goes on its way
Like you did before
<div class="chorus">Cigarette smoke and coffee stains
    These are the things that I call home
    And home I have not been in quite some time</div>

Now I'm living halfway underground
With the curtains drawn I am not about
To go losing my cool

I dodge the talkers and the transit cops
Conductors with belts full of ticket stubs
I'm proving a fool
<div class="chorus">In this city where it never rains
    And we are always at war
    The enemy is impossible to find</div>

<div class="chords">Em
C
Em/C

C
G/D
D/Em</div>
