The fog rolled up the island it rolled in off the sea  
Sat down on my doorstep and beckoned to me  
And it curled around my ankles, crawled my ear  
Whispered “keep on moving boy” soft and sweet

But I am anchored in still waters I am rooted firm and deep  
Will take more than ifs and buts to move these weary feet  
I've heard these stories all before they're lies all the same  
Time is not a prison and a home is not a grave

<div class="chorus">There is time to sow and time to reap  
Time for war and time for peace  
Time to heal, to cast away stones  
Time for coming home  
Oh yellow moon, autumn sky  
I am drifting and dry  
Oh golden sun, harvest days  
Still my wandering ways</div>

Been a hard and rocky journey but it won't be long  
I've got wings of rhythm I've got wheels of song  
It's in the falling leaf, the change of seasons  
That I have found the courage to belong

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Down in the valley chimney smoke holds up the sky  
And I'm tired of crossing oceans, states and county lines  
I have lived so many places it is easy to know  
When I should put some roots down; when I am home

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
