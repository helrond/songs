Tonight will be sleepless again  
Waiting for the sound of the rain  
For the wind to lift and the tide to shift  
For the strength to cast my cares adrift  
But tonight I will dream of you

<div class="chorus">
  Because I know not even hurricanes could blow me away<br/>
  From this place that I have let myself into<br/>
  And I know not even hurricanes could blow me away<br/>
  I am bound for the sky and bound to you
</div>

Tonight will be restless again  
Waiting for the words to proclaim  
For the waves to part for the Holy Ark  
For courage to be pure of heart  
But tonight I will dream of you

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Tonight I will be dreaming again  
Hearing the sound of your name  
Though the seas may rage and the sun may fade  
And though my heart may pace its cage  
Tonight I will dream of you
