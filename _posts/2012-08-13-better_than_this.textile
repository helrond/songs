<div class="chorus">Because I know it's gonna be
And I know it's gonna be
Yes I know it's gonna be
Better than this</div>

Well I've got no complaints
About the weather or the fates
And I'm learning to laugh at my mistakes

And love can be so cruel
But it can be tender too
It can change your mind about the thing to do
