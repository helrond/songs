Well I've got no complaints
About the weather or the waves
And I'm learning to laugh at my mistakes

And the wind can blow so strong
And the tides can all go wrong
But I will not curse the storm or the sea

<div class="chorus">Because I know it's gonna be
And I know it's gonna be
Yes I know it's gonna be
Better than this</div>

Not everything goes right but not everything is wrong

And love can be so cruel
But it can be tender too
It can change your mind about the thing to do
