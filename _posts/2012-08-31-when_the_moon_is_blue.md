Change rolls down from the mountain  
Frost creeps up through the ground  
Evening quickens and twilight fades  
The moon is lower now

I was out for the weekend  
Living fast on borrowed wheels  
Oh my friends, I had so many plans  
I had a head full of ideas

<div class="chorus">Then the music starts  
	My plans fall apart  
	You'll be out there, I'll go too  
	When the moon is blue</div>

Wild asters in the meadows  
Apples on the trees  
And one light in a window  
That is meant only for me

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
