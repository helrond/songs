When I get up to that Promised Land  
When I get up to that Promised Land  
When I get up to that Promised Land  
Won't have to tell nobody where I stand  
When I get up to that Promised Land

...won't have to lend no helping hand

...I'll be playing guitar in a honky-tonk band

...I'll be drinking whisky, shooting cans

...it'll be the end of my best laid plans

...won't have to dodge the police man

...every deal will be a winning hand
