She said Karachi broke my heart  
It will happen to you  
But by then it was too late  
I'd been taken in too

I had learned to love the traffic  
Learned to breathe the fumes  
Learned to take on my expenses  
And take off my shoes

<div class="chorus">
	Let's throw it against the wall, see if it will fall<br/>
	See how much more we can take<br/>
	Let's give it all away, pyaar honay dey<br/>
	Just let it happen and see what it will make
</div>

She said you'd better watch your step  
Out on Clifton Beach  
But I was already gone  
Drifting out to sea

another verse here  

<div class="chorus">
	CHORUS
</div>

She said you could spend your time  
Thinking about what you've to to lose  
You could stand around waiting for  
Someone to make a move

another verse here  

snow in sindh  
The ghost of John Denver out on the pier  
A place that is far from everything  

<div class="chords">
	Em/G/D/Em<br/>
	<br/>
	Em/G/D/G/C<br/>
	G/C/D<br/>
	Em/G/D/G/C<br/>
	G/C/G
</div>
