She said Karachi broke my heart  
It will happen to you  
But by then it was too late  
I'd been taken in too

I had learned to love the traffic  
Learned to breathe the fumes  
Learned to take on my expenses  
And take off my shoes

<div class="chorus">
	Let's throw it against the wall, see if it will fall  
	See how much more we can take  
	Let's give it all away, pyaar honay dey  
	Just let it happen and see what it will make
</div>

She said you'd better watch your step  
Out on Clifton Beach  
But I was already gone  
Drifting out to sea

another verse here  

<div class="chorus">
	CHORUS
</div>

She said you could spend your time  
Thinking about what you've to to lose  
You could stand around waiting for  
Someone to make a move

another verse here  

<div class="chords">
	Em/G/D/Em  

	Em/G/D/G/C  
	G/C/D  
	Em/G/D/G/C  
	G/C/G
</div>
