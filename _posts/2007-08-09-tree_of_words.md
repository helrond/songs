You would sit there for hours talking to yourself  
And the words would flow right out of you like a fountain, like a well  
You would sit there for hours talking to yourself  
Things would fold and spin and shatter; I know, I was there  

<div class="chorus">
  Oh you had me brother<br />
  You sang so sweet<br />
  Oh those words my brother<br />
  Underneath that tree<br />
  <br />
  Oh this world is wheels in wheels<br />
  Wings and waterfalls<br />
  Secrets I will never know<br />
  And names yet to be called
</div>

You would sit there for hours facing east  
All the agents of empire came on bended knee  
You would sit there for hours facing east  
And all the nations streamed towards you  
From the greatest to the least

You would sit there for hours in the shade of that tree  
At the head of the river looking out towards the sea  
You would sit there for hours in the shade of that tree  
And in the silence of that morning I fell onto my knees
