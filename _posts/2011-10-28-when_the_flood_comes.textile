There's a lot of people talking about what kind of mess we're in
And people offering advice for which nobody asked them
And people building dams, putting in wells and pumps
But when the flood comes, the water's going to run where it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, you better find a boat
When the flood comes down, something that floats
When the flood comes down</div>

There's talk about public health and decency
Respect for law and order and property
People picking through the trash, building levees out of junk
But when the flood comes, the water's going to cover what it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, you better hold that fort
When the flood comes down, shut down that port
When the flood comes down</div>

Some people live on nothing, some people got everything
Some people pay attention, some people never learn a thing
Some people claim to be something they are not
But when the flood comes, the water's going to drown who it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, you cannot hide
When the flood comes down, from a rising tide
When the flood comes down
When the flood comes down, it will be washed away
When the flood comes down, on that day
When the flood comes down</div>
