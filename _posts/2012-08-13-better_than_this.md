Well I've got no complaints  
About the weather or the waves  
And I'm learning to laugh at my mistakes

And the wind can blow so strong  
And the tides can all run wrong  
But I will not curse the storm or the sea

<div class="chorus">Because I know it's gonna be  
And I know it's gonna be  
Yes I know it's gonna be  
Better than this</div>

Oh and things are turning bad  
I've got to forget what I had  
And hold on to my friends and family

And love can be so cruel  
But it can be so tender too  
It can change your mind about the right thing to do
