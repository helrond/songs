They say parting is such sweet sorrow 
To say other would be a lie
But the future that lies before us 
Is as dark as the path behind

They say it's better safe than sorry 
In matters such as these
But I tasted the forbidden waters 
And suffered not to dream

<div class="chorus">And the fire that lies ahead 
Will burn brighter than the fire this time
And the fear of your heart's desire
Will turn your limbs to ice</div>

They say it's only a shot away 
To break out of this hypnotic trance
But to await the resurrection 
Sinner you've had your chance

They say that all will be left to memory 
The blood stains on the wall
And the screams will fade into silence 
Like the smoke trail on the hill

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They have battered your crumbling towers 
To your weary heart laid siege
But your womb it still is fertile 
And your thoughts they still run free

They say the kernel must be buried
Or it cannot bear much fruit
But how many must be buried
Before we can bear the truth

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They say parting is such sweet sorrow 
More than the heart can hold
And the future that lies before us 
Is burning in green and gold
