<div class="notes">Train ride to New Haven</div>

There's a lot of people about what kind of mess we're in<br>
And people offering advice for which nobody asked them<br>
And people building dams, putting in wells and pumps<br>
But when the flood comes, the water's going to run where it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, there will be no hiding<br>
When the flood comes down, no time for crying<br>
When the flood comes down, you'll be wet enough anyway</div>

There's talk about public health and decency<br>
Respect for law and order and property<br>
People sweeping the streets, throwing out all their junk<br>
But when the flood comes, the water's going to cover what it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, you better find a boat<br>
When the flood comes down, something that floats<br>
When the flood comes down, you better hang on tight to it</div>

Some people live on nothing, some people got everything<br>
Some people pay attention, some people never learn a thing<br>
Some people claim to be something they are not<br>
But when the flood comes, the water's going to drown who it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, there'll be no solution<br>
When the flood comes down, for those institutions<br>
When the flood comes down, and even less sympathy<br>
When the flood comes down, take your sons and daughters<br>
When the flood comes down, <br>
When the flood comes down, </div>
