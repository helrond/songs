Belting out the Beatles, Dylan and the Byrds  
Singing for his life although he doesn't know the words  
It echoed through the darkness when the power died  
I can hear him singing now; I believe he's still singing

That rhythm always came to her clear and strong  
Jumping all over Kingdom Come  
She brought this hard world right down to its knees  
I can hear her singing now; I believe she's still singing

<div class="chorus">Heard it in the thunder, heard it in the rain  
Drift through the fences, roll across the plains  
Hum through the airwaves and rumble underground  
Tell me what could be (what could be)  
What could be the size of that sound</div>

Squeezing out the hope in each half-remembered line  
Waging war with his fingers and a whiskey-soaked mind  
The straight story served with a bad attitude  
I can hear him singing now; I believe he's still singing

Puts her babies down to sleep with a song all her own  
Borne across the ocean to this Appalachian town  
The sound of harmony, the sound of home  
I can hear her singing now; I believe she's still singing

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When he sang hallelujah in that dry and dusty place  
Were the very stones shaken by that most amazing grace  
The feast for famine, drought for the flood  
I can hear him singing now; I believe he's still singing

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
