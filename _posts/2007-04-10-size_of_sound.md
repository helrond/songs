Belting out the Beatles, Dylan and the Byrds  
Singing for his life although he doesn't know the words  
It echoed through the darkness when the power died  
I can hear him singing now; I believe he's still singing

That rhythm always came to her clear and strong  
Jumping all over Kingdom Come  
She brought this hard world right down to its knees  
I can hear her singing now; I believe she's still singing

<div class="chorus">
  Heard it in the thunder, heard it in the rain<br/>
  Drift through the fences, roll across the plains<br/>
  Hum through the airwaves and rumble underground<br/>
  Tell me what could be (what could be)<br/>
  What could be the size of that sound
</div>

Squeezing out the hope in each half-remembered line  
Waging war with his fingers and a whiskey-soaked mind  
The straight story served with a bad attitude  
I can hear him singing now; I believe he's still singing

Puts her babies down to sleep with a song all her own  
Borne across the ocean to this Appalachian town  
The sound of harmony, the sound of home  
I can hear her singing now; I believe she's still singing

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When he sang hallelujah in that dry and dusty place  
Were the very stones shaken by that most amazing grace  
The feast for famine, drought for the flood  
I can hear him singing now; I believe he's still singing

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
