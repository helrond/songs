It was the summer of dreams, they were dancing in the field
And thinking that the future was full of possibilities
Now they're miles past those years, those guitars and jeans
They've taken to preaching and growing out their beards

They were just kids in school, doing things that kids will do
Not looking to be a number leading the news
But those faces on the page were all blurred or turned away
Like getting out alive was to be ashamed

<div class="chorus">
	And the distance, oh the distance
	It stretches out before me, other lands and other lives
	In the distance, oh the distance
	Can I make more of your life without making less of mine?
</div>

We stood in different lines, you had yours and I had mine
As if the color of our passports made us of two different kinds
As if a nation could be only geography
And edges were destined not to bleed

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chorus">May the thread and the needle hold
May the light remain illuminated
May the caravan go on</div>
