Every time I look that number is there
But simple mathematics are more than I can bear
The faces on the page are all blurred or turned away
Like getting out alive was to be ashamed

<div class="chorus">
	And the distance, oh the distance
	It stretches out before me, other lands and other lives
	In the distance, oh the distance
	Can I make more of your life without making less of mine?
</div>

Man I wonder about this world, about the things I've seen and heard
If we're lying to ourselves about the debts that we've incurred
And I wander through my years thinking where to go from here
Will memory be all that is left to me

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chorus">May the thread and the needle hold
May the light remain illuminated
May the caravan go on</div>
