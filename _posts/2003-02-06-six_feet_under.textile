A liar is the worst kind of coward and I have been that
A fool dies a thousand deaths and I have died some
But I was not a fool or a liar for you I tried to deceive myself
And now I am through with all this shit
And happiness is not my goal

<div class="chorus">You are as dead as Jacob Marley
You are as dead as a night on the sound
You are dead and I don't mind saying
You are six feet under the ground</div>

You said to leave the past behind me and I have done that
You said to do what makes me happy and I have been some
But I was not about to leave what I have cursed and sweated for
And now I am through with playing mind games
And speaking in shifting codes

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
