Do you know that I see through your eyes
December skies and concrete lies
Beyond the walls of your showroom halls
See it all, see it all, and down it falls

Subway glances, subzero heart
Don't look at me, I'm falling apart
Does life happen when you're gone
Anyone can see we're nearly done

Don't you look, I'll go away
Come back again another day
Stay cool, don't act odd
Same ol' life under the sword

Walk in, walk out, keep on dreaming
Red, white and blue, the colors screaming
One day you'll get your dream house
Then you'll die from the fallout
