<div class="notes">for Craig</div>

I met a ghost  
And I thought that it was me  
Mighty like Casey, with Ezekiel's knees  
I met a ghost  
And it looked a lot like me  
In the hand of Michaelangelo, wearing Abe Lincoln's beard

I met a ghost  
Blowing smoke into the breeze  
Had a hand made out of poetry and a head made of steel  
Said I'm in love  
And I can't fight this disease  
I got them crawling out my fingertips, I am a factory

<div class="chorus">
  I met a ghost yeah<br/>
  I met a ghost<br/>
  I met a ghost yeah<br/>
  A ghost yeah a ghost<br/>
  I met a ghost
</div>

I met a ghost  
And I knew it was me  
He said I've got a heart, I beg you, don't believe  
Me I'm old  
And I'm showing my years  
My heart is angry and distracted; a buzzing sack of bees
