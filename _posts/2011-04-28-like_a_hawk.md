I will wait patiently, like a hawk  
I will pay no mind to wind and rain or the heat of the sun  
And when everything has failed and all our promises are gone  
I will wait patiently, like a hawk

I will watch carefully, like a hawk  
I will see everything that moves in the daytime or the night  
Standing guard over my failings and the inventions of my mind  
I will watch carefully, like a hawk

I will stay faithfully, like a hawk  
Without fear of what will be, of the inevitable slope  
I will not be swayed by hunger or betrayed by hope  
I will stay faithfully, like a hawk
