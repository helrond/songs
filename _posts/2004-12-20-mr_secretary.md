Mister Secretary  
I know you don't know my name  
I know that you are truly grateful  
That you are not the only one to blame

Mister Secretary  
I have just one demand  
If I die in this godforsaken place  
Sign the letter by hand

<div class="chorus">You can send me off to fight your dirty jihad  
You can hang me out to dry  
You can sign me up let them cut me to pieces  
Just put your John Hancock on the line</div>

Mister Secretary  
I know you don't read the news  
I know we fight with the army we have  
Not the army we'd choose

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Mister Secretary  
I know there's solid evidence  
I know that all the armor in the world  
Is not a sufficient defense

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
G/D/C/C  

C/G/D/G</div>
