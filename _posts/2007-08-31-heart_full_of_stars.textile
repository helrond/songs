Compared to some you've been around
But goodbyes still get you down
Never one to break the news
And I know how you bruise

You've got ways to hold it in
To betray the best of things
All that rage and all that love
You can never get enough

<div class="chorus">And each time you hit the wall
You stumble and you fall
Just remember who you are
And your heart full of stars
You can buy a brand new car
Drive it fast and drive it hard
But you'll never get too far running from your scars
And your heart full of stars</div>Oh your heart and your shoes
They will go just where they choose
They will let loose their strings
You will get tangled in

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You move on from place to place
As if to test the grasp of grace
But your smiles and your tears
Are two things I still believe

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Am/F/C/G
Am/F/C/G
