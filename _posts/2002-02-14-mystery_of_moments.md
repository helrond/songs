My love's at the water's edge  
Pulling up lustrife and sedge  
She's bringing me flowers to wear  
My love's at the water's edge

My love is a runaway train  
Walking barefoot in the rain  
Down in the valley she's howling my name  
My love is a runaway train

My love is a holy nation  
A sign of contradiction  
Like a black crow rests on a juniper tree  
My love is a holy nation

<div class="chorus">Now I stand before your mystery  
Now I stand before your grace  
Now I stand before your radiance  
Now I stand before your face</div>

My love hears an outdated tune  
She dances with the moon  
She comes to me, she says taste and see  
My love hears an outdated tune

My love's at the water's edge  
Pulling up lustrife and sedge  
She's bringing me flowers to wear  
My love's at the water's edge

<div class="chorus">And if I fall before your mystery  
I will not fall beyond your grace  
And if I fall beyond your radiance  
I will not fall before your face</div>
<div class="chords">
