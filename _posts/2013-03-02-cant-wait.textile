I have always wanted to see
Angels in the branches of a tree
Hear a voice speaking to me
From somewhere I can't see

And I thought of my life as scenes
Perfectly lit and played by someone else

I have been waiting to be moved
To know what it is that I am meant to do

<div class="chorus">I can't wait anymore for it to come to me
I can't take anymore or keep buying what I can make for free</div>

I will move and be moved

Prime mover
