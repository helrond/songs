I have always wanted to see
Angels in the branches of a tree
Thought that I would know for sure
But the more I tried to listen, the less I heard

I believe in certainty
That would never fade, much less disappear
Hear a voice speaking to me
From somewhere I can't see

I have been waiting to be moved
To know what it is that I am meant to do

The lack of visions and signs
Has not changed the language I have taken as mine
Does not make me less holy or my faith a lie

<div class="chorus">I can't wait anymore for it to come to me
I can't say anymore it's not how I want it to be</div>
