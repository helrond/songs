I have always wanted to see
Angels in the branches of a tree
Hear a voice speaking to me
From somewhere I can't see

I believe in certainty
That would never fade, much less disappear
Thought that I would know for sure
But the harder I listened, the less I heard

<div class="chorus">I can't wait anymore for it to come to me
I can't say anymore it's not how I want it to be</div>

I have been waiting to be moved
To know what it is that I am meant to do
But I've discovered lately where I stand
And the farther back I step the closer I am
