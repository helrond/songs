<div class="chorus">Float on the water,<br/>
Blown by the wind<br/>
In every direction<br/>
And nothing within<br/>
Form without function<br/>
Art with no core<br/>
Shells</div>

Put up a facade, don't let them reach you  
Break down the bridge, you're safer with no clue  
But when all the connections are gone  
Don't look back 'cause your life will be gone

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Keep it sweet, plenty of kisses  
You know how, will they miss you  
If I die in my sleep tonight  
What will they say about my life

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

This static growth, stunted and rotting  
You're dead inside and stop existing  
Yeah you crumble, inward you fall  
Can't look up, you were so tall

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">
  G/D/Em/D<br/>
  G/D/C/D<br/>
  <br/>
  G/D/Em/D<br/>
  G/D/C/D<br/>
  G/D/C/G<br/>
  G/D/C/D
</div>
