Between the lines in a sea of blackness, past telescoping signs  
This night was longer than it seemed but I was never tired  
The shooting stars were out that night, falling just like rain  
I was thinking on the morning, I was thinking things could change

<div class="chorus">
  Do you want to know what lies behind the mist<br/>
  Do you want to know how many died for this<br/>
  Can you tell we are already there<br/>
  Who would have known there'd be<br/>
  Roses in November
</div>

Take a breath, say a prayer, don't look back, there's nothing there  
Did I come here for this, is there something I missed why is no one scared  
Read the line, drew the line, crossed it out and crossed over  
If your conscience bears no consequence who's left to suffer

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
