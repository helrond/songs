There's a rule for every number  
And a place for everything  
There's a word for every notion  
A perfect description

<div class="chorus">
  Well nothing is everything<br />
  And anyway there is not one thing you could do to make me believe<br />
  The numbers never lie
</div>

Mr. Dewey we don't need you anymore  
So pack up your papers and leave  
You take your numbers, I'll take my time  
Consider it a deal

That is no way to live a life; in an  
Alphabetical scheme  
Every time you write it down  
Please remember me

I won't ask you what you want it for
