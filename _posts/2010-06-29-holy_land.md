Stop said the man listen and you will hear  
There's a wind blowing out of the east and it's bringing fear  
You've got to get off the ride and walk and learn a new way to talk  
You're going to have to learn to say goodbye

<div class="chorus">
  There's not much here that isn't holy land<br/>
  Take off your shoes take notice where you stand
</div>

Stop said the man I will tell you what you lack  
When you lose your way you must ask to get it back  
You've got to get down on your knees if you really want to see  
Got to let them look you in the eye

<div class="chorus">
  And all around you this is holy ground<br/>
  Give up your speculations, your demands
</div>

Stop said the man, listen and do not fear  
There's a wind blowing out of the east and it's already here  
There's a lot to understand if you want to be a better man  
So much to which you'll have to say goodbye

<div class="chorus">
  There's not much here that isn't holy land<br/>
  Take off your shoes take notice where you stand<br/>
  And all around you this is holy ground<br/>
  Give up your speculations, your demands
</div>
