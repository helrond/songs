Do you remember the rain
The way that it came
When it fell there was nowhere to go
Do you remember the rain

Do you remember the sun
How it burned how it shone
In the season too early for shade
Do you remember the sun

Do you remember the snow
How it covered us both
And the silence that spoke nothing false
Do you remember the snow

<div class="chorus">BRIDGE</div>

Do you remember the rain
The way that it came
And how it broke, how hard it fell
Do you remember the rain
