Dreaming  
I think I am dreaming again  
I see a house, paint chipped and multicolored  
That we are fond of rebuilding,  
but reluctant to rebuild

The foundation is cracked, the walls are eroding,  
It will fall soon  
A blue collared crew had gathered  
wrecking ball ready, they will knock it down  
and prepare to erect a new

I recognize God as one of the workers  
He had no white beard and no wrath  
He is taut muscle, and laugh  
He brings a bagged lunch  
And smokes a pack and a half each day

He smokes while he unloads the trucks  
and hands the fresh lumber to us

We are ready to build this new house,  
a simple house, something pure and patriotic  
something we can step inside and call our own  
and strong house built on the backs of believers

and out across the lawn I see God,  
leaning up against a tree and smiling  
because we have had the answers all along,  
and so we build from dusk till dawn

One by one, this house  
and then beyond
