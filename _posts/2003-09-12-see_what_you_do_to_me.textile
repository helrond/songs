You got me crawling on the floor you got me begging for more
See what you do to me
You got me about to lose my mind you got me dying all the time
See what you do to me
And when I say that I want to be your man
I'm running naked through the town
See what you do to me

You got me singing in the rain you got me shouting out your name 
See what you do to me
You got me praying in the dark you got me naked in the park
See what you do to me
I when I say that I have no more to lose
I mean that I have to be with you
See what you do to me

You got me falling on my knees you got me begging please
See what you do to me
You got me feeling like a king you got me wanting it again
See what you do to me
And when I say that I'll give you all I can
I'll throw my life like water onto sand
See what you do to me
