Sterilized halls, immaculate lawns  
Programmed minds, go above and beyond  
We've got all our trash behind the gate  
Regular pick-ups at quarter to eight

<div class="chorus">Sometimes the trash can just overflows<br/>
Something slips out, can't find where it goes<br/>
Sometimes people, well, they just have a will<br/>
Catch them soon, or we'll all see your road kill</div>

Secret documents, nope, they're all gone  
Torture manuals, what are you on  
Our soldiers are good, honest and true  
Even if sometimes we lose a few

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

He was a soldier, good, honest and true  
His mind, well, he must have lost a few  
He chose to live out on the street  
I'm telling you man, he was really beat

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When he came back, we shot him up  
Who needs those bums and their cups  
We forgot, for once, to clean up our mess  
And now it's news all over the U.S.

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/Em/Am/D<br/>
<br/>
G/D/C/D</div>
