I want you to soar
Like a gull into the wind
But freedom dictates it own terms
And humans don't have wings

<div class="chorus">There are times to sink into a haze of perfect distraction
Times to dwell in clarity and times to live in sin
There are times to remember and times to regret
Times I want my opium</div>

I want you to rise up
Like Lazarus from your tomb
But there is no one to call you forth
No one to touch your wounds

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I want you to burn
Like Rome while Nero plays
But I know too well a fire needs a spark
A moment to sets hearts ablaze

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">
