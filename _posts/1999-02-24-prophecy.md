I get tired of seeing my own face  
I get tired of feeling my constraints  
I get tired of hearing the lies  
I get tired of being paralyzed  

When did truth become relative to the imperial palace edifice  
When did love become hate and justice fate  
I want to know when life gave up the ghost  
When joy died in bed and science lost its head

History is a parade of mistakes  
Government no more than we fake  
Beauty is on sale for less  
And murderer's weapons are become blessed

<div class="chorus">
  When will the day come when we all will know<br/>
  That nothing stands between us and the way back home<br/>
  When will the day come when we all will see<br/>
  That all the thoughts we hold inside won't make us free<br/>
  <br/>
  Come let us go to the mountain of the lord<br/>
  Death will meet life and age to youth<br/>
  Where the hand of another will never hold a sword<br/>
  And we will walk in the light of truth
</div>

Give me half a chance to gain my omnipotence  
Give yourself a chance to be more than indifferent  
Peace is taken out to die, hope is falling from the sky  
Joy is lost in the river's fall as justice takes the final call

<div class="chorus">
  Come let us go to the mountain of the lord<br/>
  Death will meet life and age to youth<br/>
  Where the hand of another will never hold a sword<br/>
  And we will walk in the light of truth
</div>
