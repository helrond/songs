I dream clipper ships flying machines  
Beauty moving at the speed of light eagles under these wings  
Beauty moving at the speed of light I have kept to my feet  
I have kept to my feet

I have been hurricanes tradewinds and undertow  
I have offered no man dominion of the heavens I own  
I have offered no man dominion not of flesh nor of bone  
Not of flesh not of bone

<div class="chorus">And did these hands (you are you are you are my hands)  
And did these feet (you are you are you are my hands)  
Walk these hills and draw these lines of sight  
And did these hands (you are you are you are my hands)  
And did these feet (you are you are you are my hands)  
Find eternity in the kingdoms of the mind</div>

Take me as your son teach me how to grow  
Burn my distrust my abstract perfection burn my reverent soul  
Burn my distrust my abstract perfection keep me hungry and cold  
Keep me hungry and cold

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I'm a highwayman and I always will be  
With the sun lifting off the horizon within infinity  
With the sun lifting off the horizon become what I see  
Become what I see

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
