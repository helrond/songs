Say what you will and say what you want my friend  
Say what you will and say what you want again  
Because I've been watching you for hours with your amphetamines and flowers  
Say what you want my ordinary friend

Turn the radio on and tune it in  
Turn that radio on, confess your sin  
Tell the only ones who know, Doctor Brinkley, Tokyo Rose  
Turn that radio up and listen in

<div class="chorus">It's the way it used to be  
The same things coming down over the sea  
And I know he waits for me  
Dressed in rhinestones and pushing speed</div>

Sun coming up across the Great Divide  
Shadows running down the other side  
And you waited like a gong holding ashes on your tongue  
As the sun comes up across the Great Divide

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/F/C  
C/F/G  
F/C/Am/G  
F/G/C  

F/G/C  
Am/F/G  
F/G/C  
Am/G/C</div>
