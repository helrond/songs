<div class="notes">Words by Clement Arnold, music by Hillel Arnold</div>

As I look down at the rushing stream, shining waves of blue  
I think of God's creation, how he made it all for you  
So I look up at the shining sky to see a flock of geese fly  
By, and a beautiful sunset span the sky

<div class="chorus">
  God's Creation<br/>
  God's Creation is the best thing a man can see<br/>
  God's Creation<br/>
  God's Creations is the best thing there will ever be
</div>

Slowly the sun sinks down behind the hills  
But a bit of color still remains  
Slowly the night sky covers all the plains  
The stars light my way as I walk homeward

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
