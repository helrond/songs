The writing's not just on the wall it's in the dirt  
And stones are everywhere for angry hands  
They're feeding the lions to the Christians this time  
And the gates of Eden have been closed to man  

<div class="chorus">We bear witness when we are sleeping  
We bear witness with every waking thought  
We bear witness and though I am not my father's son  
We bear witness to the works of our God</div>

Hanoi Jane tells me there's nothing left to lose  
Principle in trade for capital  
The Pied Piper is refusing to post bond  
And there's dancing â€˜round the bonfires of war

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Demons bearing crosses and angels bearing arms  
A pile of shit is not a diamond mine  
You say your health is bearing up but I am bearing down  
And if you hear the word you are mine

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
G/C/D/G  
C/D/G  

G/C/G  
G/C/D  
G/D/G/Em  
G/D/G</div>
