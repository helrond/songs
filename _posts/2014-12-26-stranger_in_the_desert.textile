Strangers in the desert where are you bound?
Do you know he place where the lightning comes down
Tell me who has built these mountains high
Will you go my way? Will you lend me your light?

Strangers in the desert, is it you that I've seen
Sailing your ships along underground streams
In the river beds I feel your hands
Pulling at my steps through the loose sand

<div class="chorus">
	When you are gone, I know you were there
	A coyote running through my prayers
	And I know one day all will be revealed
	And the space between mountains and sky will disappear
</div>

Strangers in the desert, stand your ground
Measure out the distance to the promised land
At the gates of dawn you stand alone
Through the cactus and the dust, safe at home
