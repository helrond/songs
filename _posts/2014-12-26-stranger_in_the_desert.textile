<div class="note">at Joshua Tree</div>

Strangers in the desert where are you bound?
Do you know he place where the Lightning comes down
Will you tell me who has built these mountains high
Will you go my way? Will you lend me your light?

Strangers in the desert, is it you that I've seen
Sailing your ships along underground streams
Walking the edges of the fire has run aground
Pulling at my footsteps through the loose sand

<div class="chorus">
	When I do not see you, then I know you are there
	Dressed as a coyote, running through my dreams
	And I know one day all will be revealed
	And the distance between the mountains and the sky will disappear
</div>

Strangers in the desert, stand your ground
Measure out the distance to the promised land
