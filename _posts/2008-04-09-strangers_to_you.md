You were drifting, you were blown  
You were out there on your own  
Riding lonely through the dust  
Red rock canyons, wind and rust

You were lost in those stories told  
Purple sage and desert gold  
In the lamplight your heroes shone  
Past midnight they went on and on

<div class="chorus">
  Without fear without pride making honor your guide<br />
  You rode off to that long sunrise<br />
  Everybody that came they called you by name<br />
  None were strangers, strangers to you
</div>

You were justice served complete  
Judge and jury, rope and steel  
Always cautious with your trust  
Shooting only when you must

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Knew the thirst and felt the freeze  
And you struggled just to breathe  
First man in and the last one out  
None could fit into your coat

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
