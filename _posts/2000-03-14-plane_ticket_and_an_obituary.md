I don't need a plane ticket to fly  
I don't need a mountain to reach the sky  
I don't need an obituary  
I don't need a river to reach the sea

How did you let your mind die  
How did your eyes go blind  
How did your fingers go numb  
How did you pale under the sun

<div class="chorus">
  Everybody knows the signs<br/>
  Nobody will be there sometimes<br/>
  Nobody tries to die and<br/>
  Everybody tries not to try
</div>

I don't need a plane ticket to fly  
I don't need a mountain to reach the sky  
I don't need an obituary  
I don't need a river to reach the sea
