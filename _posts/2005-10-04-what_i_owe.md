<div class="notes">Words and music by Hillel Arnold and Josh Gardner</div>

With half of Texas blowing off to the east  
And the other half stuck to my feet  
Took what was left of my love and money  
And headed for the sea

If it rained for forty days  
I don't believe this desert would bloom  
If I find better luck in the city  
I'll sing it to a picture of you

<div class="chorus">What I owe is more than I can render  
What I owe is buried in the desert sand  
What I owe is lost and gone forever  
What I owe is who I am</div>

With all to show for five years labor  
A hard luck nickel and my name  
Hopped the freight, the old South Central  
And headed for those fertile plains

My descendants for seven generations  
Are promised to the factory store  
What was real I gave to my real friends  
If I could I'd give them some more

<div class="chorus">What I owe is more than I can render  
What I owe is buried in the desert sand  
What I owe is lost and gone forever  
What I owe is who I am</div>

All I have is the song I sing; it binds us you and me  
From California to New York Island, I'm always with my family  
I'm on my way just like I went, weary, broke and cold  
Been down so far so long that it's the only thing I know  

<div class="chorus">What I owe is more than I can render  
What I owe is signed in a stranger's hand  
What I owe is lost and I don't remember  
What I owe is who I am</div>
