We've got places to get to
We've all got places to go
We've got means, ways and motives
We've got wheels, we've all got roads

There will be things to carry
There will be a heavy load
And the hardest place to travel
Is the country you've built on your own

<div class="chorus">
    You've got to know the shape of things before you set your course
    You've got to know if speed or scenery is what matters most
    Chart out all the crossings and carry the right pass
    And when you get to where you're going remember what you've passed
</div>

You can spend your life certain
Here is not where you belong
Or you can make home in yourself
And settle down in hope
