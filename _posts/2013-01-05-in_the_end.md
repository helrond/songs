<div class="notes">in Granada</div>

We walked around the city walls  
Our breath hung in the air and dying stars held up the sky  
We talked about the rise and fall  
The houses that we dwelled in and the way we live and die

Did you mean love or history  
Or what could not be seen from just a single point  
When you said love, do you not see  
Perfection is a place where you and I are not

<div class="chorus">
  In the end there is only one victor<br/>
  In the end there is only one God<br/>
  Wa la ghalib illa 'llah<br/>
  In the end, in the end
</div>

We talked of blood, we ate the seeds  
And how our eyes travel and the way we understand  
In among the cypress trees  
I learned that distance and detail are all part of the plan

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chords">
