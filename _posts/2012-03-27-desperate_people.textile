Desperate people will do anything
If a door is locked they will kick it in
And if you dare to cross them, you will see
Desperate people are dangerous and mean
    
Desperate people will believe in anything
    
Desperate people are up for anything
    
Desperate people aren't scared of anything

Desperate people don't care about wrong or right
As long as it will get them through the night

    
<div class="chorus">
So if you keep my belly full and keep me dry and warm
Let me have enough so I can worry about it
I won't start a scene, a revolution or a war
Desperate people do desperate things</div>

I've got just enough to keep me from being desperate
    
My anxiety is the color of money
    
can't be free with a safety net
