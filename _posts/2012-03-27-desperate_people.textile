Desperate people will do anything
If a door is locked they will kick it in
And if you dare to cross them, you will see
Desperate people are dangerous and mean

<div class="chorus">
They might be the ones to bring it crashing down
To tear down the walls and let justice roll on down
And they will end what they begin
Desperate people do desperate things</div>
    
Desperate people will believe anything
That will lift them up or let them in
Desperate people don't care about wrong or right
As long as it will get them through the night
    
Desperate people aren't scared of anything
Society or consequence, laws or discipline
They don't have principles, they'll act on any whim
Desperate people are up for anything
