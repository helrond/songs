Went down south last summer
Chasing the sun
Looking for some new light
On things that I had done

Went into the mountains
To find the highest peak
Got lost down in the valley
That's where I feell asleep

<div class="chorus">
Light travels east to west
Rivers run where there is less
All the time you take you will never lose
Wherever you are headed, the journey it finds you
</div>

I followed the river
Heading upstream
And a flood came down the valley
Washed me out to sea

I went towards the sunrise
To move my timeline ahead
I was frozen by its power
Unlearning everything I'd read

<div class="chords">
C/G
F/C/G

F/C/G
</div>
