I don't know if I should laugh or scream in our time, in our time
Hold my position or hide my trail in the stream in our time, in our time
To howl at the moon or bury my head in the sand in our time, in our time
If it's a joke or a nightmare, hypnosis or a spell, these times are slipping through my hands

Hidden screaming horses and cowering men in our time, in our time
I've seen you out there on the highway trading flesh and sin in our time, in our time
I have prayed to God Almighty that justice would be done in our time, in our time
Blocked up my ears and eyes, mouth, mind and nose, these times are almost gone

There are tears in my eyes from the smoke blown in my face in our time, in our time
My conscience hangs in tatters my allegiance in disgrace in our time, in our time
The battle cries ring hollow though I have the will to fight in our time, in our time
I've seen a wheel in a wheel, I've seen the Valley of Dry Bones but these are times I can't tell wrong from right
