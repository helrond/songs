There's a rule for every number
And a place for everything
There's a word for every notion
A perfect description

<div class="chorus">Well nothing is everything
And anyway there is not one thing you could do to make me believe
The numbers never lie</div>

Mr. Dewey we don't need you anymore
So pack up your papers and leave
You take your numbers, I'll take my time
Consider it a deal

That is no way to live a life; in an
Alphabetical scheme
Every time you write it down
Please remember me

I won't ask you what you want it for

discovery
