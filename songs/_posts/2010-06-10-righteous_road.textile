Gotta keep walking that righteous road
Gotta take up that heavy load
Pick your head up off the floor
Get your feet out of the door

<div class="chorus">Make your way out of the city
Make your way across town</div>

Gotta keep walking that righteous road
Gotta believe the things I know
Takes more than this world can bring
To find out the shape I'm in

<div class="chorus">Make your way from consolation
Make your way through rocky ground</div>

Gotta keep walking that righteous road
Gotta lay down that heavy load
Forget about the things you lose
Make your life some kind of use

<div class="chorus">Make your way from all concession
Make your way back to yourself</div>

<div class="chords">
