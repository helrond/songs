The daffodils on the kitchen table
Are leaning toward the light
By this time tomorrow
They will have died

I was walking down Eighth Avenue
On the day you died
I knew exactly when it happened
By the change in the light

I've always felt uneasy with my feet off the ground

It takes time for my head and stomach to catch up with a change in altitude
