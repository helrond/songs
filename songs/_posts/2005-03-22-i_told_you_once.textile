I told you once
I'm not saying it again
You either step back off yourself
Or you'll be dealing with my friends

I told you once
It's not funny anymore
You better drop that shit this second
Or I'm walking out the door

Now you're screaming bloody murder
Like a pig who just got stuck
Here's a quarter, go call someone
â€˜Cause I don't give a fuck

So you're scared
Hell aren't we all
Get your head out of your ass and
Get your feet back on the floor

And if you've got a cross I've got a shoulder to lean it on
Go on and lay your burden down, it's not heavy, it's not _________
I've heard this one before, it goes ABC
It's the same fucking song, in a slightly different key
