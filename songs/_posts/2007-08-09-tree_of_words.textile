You would sit there for hours talking to yourself
And the words would flow right out of you like a fountain, like a well
You would sit there for hours talking to yourself
Things would fold and spin and shatter; I know, I was there

<div class="chorus">Oh you had me brother
You sang so sweet
Oh those words my brother
Underneath that tree

Oh this world is wheels in wheels
Wings and waterfalls
Secrets I will never know
And names yet to be called</div>

You would sit there for hours facing east
All the agents of empire came on bended knee
You would sit there for hours facing east
And all the nations streamed towards you
From the greatest to the least

You would sit there for hours in the shade of that tree
At the head of the river looking out towards the sea
You would sit there for hours in the shade of that tree
And in the silence of that morning I fell onto my knees
