Silence reigns in the beauty parlor
Rusting Russian tanks and empty American shells

<div class="chorus">Cash in Kabul (You know where we're at man)
Cash in Kabul (All day long)
Cash in Kabul (I just want the facts man)
Cash in Kabul (All night long)</div>

And I walked in holding my guidebook

If I am an immigrant in my own country
Then what am I here
