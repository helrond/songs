Neither incumbent nor activist

Finally I have learned
In every moment and task a chance
For the smallness of transcendence

Every moment has a soul
Every job deserves to be the only one

Living is not an art, it is a craft

Do the thing you're doing really well

Forget about averages and history
Tides and ripples and echoes and memory
What your grandchildren will think of me

Once it starts to sway there's only one way it can go

After all, who needs eyes to see
And diamonds will never make you believe

Butterfly effect
