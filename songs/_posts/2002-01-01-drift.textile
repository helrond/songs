She said it's cold in here as she pulled the blankets up to her chin
I rolled over and fell off the edge into the sea of my sin
Captain oh my captain I am caught adrift
No stars to guide this sailor home no wind these sails to lift

She said she'd known all along or at least a couple of days
I never meant to be telling a lie so maybe I wanted to fail
Tell me oh my brother where the current flows
I can feel I am in motion where it leads to I don't know

<div class="chorus">If we could only swim
Under this sea of fire
We could keep our sins from turning to stone
But the rivers have run dry</div>
