One glance from you was all it took
One word I did not understand
And your laughter cut me off right at the knees
Laid me out to die on the sand

<div class="chorus">So I built myself a tower
And I climbed up to the top
But it all came tumbling down</div>


And we are locked inside our walls
And we look out our own windows
And we can only walk out our own doors

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

But we know all of the loopholes and all of the cracks
The tunnels and the fords into the heart
The weaknesses to our defense
The places where we break apart

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
