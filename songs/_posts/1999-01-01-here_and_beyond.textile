When the iron curtain fell I was standing there
More surprised than I cared to admit

When the borders were closed I was sitting there opposed

When the verdict came down I was kneeling on the ground
My head in my hands

Asymetry
Sanctions

What is here and what is beyond

You can leave my failed aggression dangling

I know you have tried to hide your hatred
And I for my part have forgotten how much I love you
