<div class="notes">"In the words of the prophet Isaiah, â€œLift your eyes and look to the heavens who created all these. He who brings out the starry hosts one by one and calls them, each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing."
-G. W. Bush</div>

It's the smallest things that kill when you're in outer space

Thirty-eight miles high a cowboy rides the clear blue sky over eastern Texas
His silver ship and his gleaming gun reflecting morning sunlight
His face is radiant 
So before it all ends in a flash of light brighter than the sun

Debris raining down over Nagacdoches

Countdown clock counting up
