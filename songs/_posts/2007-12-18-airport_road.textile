Take it four lanes wide all the way
At ninety miles per hour
Tumbleweeds blow down ambush alley
And it will blow your confidence down

<div class="chorus">Airport Road you stole my brother
Airport Road you took my friend
You say take it easy but you do not deceive me
I am not going back there again</div>

Out on the highway just past midnight
The asphalt is cold as hell
There's a man standing there with a rock in each hand
And he's praying to Allah for help

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

And though I drive down Route Irish
I will not be afraid
A gunner in the turret
Is my comfort and aid
