I've got friends who say that they're always alone
And there is nowhere left to go
The have all been everywhere
But none of them have left their home

<div class="chorus">Put on your traveling shoes
Get off the highway, turn off the news
Go somewhere you've never been and
Take someone with you</div>

There are certain songs that cannot be sung alone
And stories that cannot be told
And you can never hope to sell
All the things you've got to tell

Home is always somewhere in between
Our feet and the ground
