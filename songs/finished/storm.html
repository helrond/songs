<div class="lyrics">When I was young I used to hide from the storm<br />
Cover face with hands in a corner of home<br />
Run hug mommy's leg and try not to cry<br />
As lightning flashed and wind tore the sky<br />
<br />
I am older now and far from home<br />
I have no choice but to be out in the storm<br />
Dance with death as the lightning bolts crash down<br />
And when i can't see try to feel my way around

<div class="chorus">I look for stars in the night<br />
Fumble east to see the daylight<br />
Will my never life take flight<br />
And my blindness turn to sight</div>

It's easy for me to tell you how it goes<br />
Maybe that's why i think that i know<br />
I can move mountains and crawl through the eye<br />
A needle whose ego is bigger than mine<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Won't you be my light and my salvation<br />
In times like these in this evil nation<br />
I need a little hope, a little joy between hits<br />
And the word is i can't take much more of this
