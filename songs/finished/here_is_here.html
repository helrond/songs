<div class="lyrics">My baby wishes she was in London<br />
Her friends want to move to New York<br />
My sister lives in San Francisco<br />
But her heart is still in El Salvador

<div class="chorus">Here is here<br />
And now and then<br />
You've been wondering where you've been</div>

My brother wants to get away from Canton<br />
He doesn't care for France or Italy<br />
My friends who live out in the country<br />
Know there is somewhere they would rather be

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I want to be in ancient Athens<br />
Or Moscow in 1963<br />
I want to wear dark sunglasses<br />
And drive down the Champs Elysees
