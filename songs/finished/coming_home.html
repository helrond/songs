<div class="lyrics">The fog rolled up the island it rolled in off the sea<br />
Sat down on my doorstep and beckoned to me<br />
And it curled around my ankles, crawled my ear<br />
Whispered “keep on moving boy” soft and sweet<br />
<br />
But I am anchored in still waters I am rooted firm and deep<br />
Will take more than ifs and buts to move these weary feet<br />
I've heard these stories all before they're lies all the same<br />
Time is not a prison and a home is not a grave

<div class="chorus">There is time to sow and time to reap<br />
Time for war and time for peace<br />
Time to heal, to cast away stones<br />
Time for coming home<br />
Oh yellow moon, autumn sky<br />
I am drifting and dry<br />
Oh golden sun, harvest days<br />
Still my wandering ways</div>

Been a hard and rocky journey but it won't be long<br />
I've got wings of rhythm I've got wheels of song<br />
It's in the falling leaf, the change of seasons<br />
That I have found the courage to belong

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Down in the valley chimney smoke holds up the sky<br />
And I'm tired of crossing oceans, states and county lines<br />
I have lived so many places it is easy to know<br />
When I should put some roots down; when I am home

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
