You can see me on the corner on the south side of Washington hustling librarians<br/>
Or catch me hanging out by the vending machines on the internet making friends<br/>
<br/>
I've been running guns out of Mamdouha's office, you should see the stuff I keep in there<br/>
I touch Elmer's nose when I take the elevator; I never take the stairs

<div class="chorus">I'm a Bobst Boy<br/>
Bobst Boy<br/>
Bobst Boy</div>

I'm a pirate in the park, scaring tourists in the dark, you should see the way I make them jump<br/>
And I shower in the bathroom and sleep in reserves, I haven't gotten laid in months

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I do my homework in McDonalds, eat my bagels in the commons, I can sleep almost anywhere<br/>
And I work every day but I can't live on what I'm paid; I'm often bored or scared

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
