<div class="lyrics">The writing's not just on the wall it's in the dirt<br />
And stones are everywhere for angry hands<br />
They're feeding the lions to the Christians this time<br />
And the gates of Eden have been closed to man

<div class="chorus">We bear witness when we are sleeping<br />
We bear witness with every waking thought<br />
We bear witness and though I am not my father's son<br />
We bear witness to the works of our God</div>

Hanoi Jane tells me there's nothing left to lose<br />
Principle in trade for capital<br />
The Pied Piper is refusing to post bond<br />
And there's dancing â€˜round the bonfires of war

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Demons bearing crosses and angels bearing arms<br />
A pile of shit is not a diamond mine<br />
You say your health is bearing up but I am bearing down<br />
And if you hear the word you are mine

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
