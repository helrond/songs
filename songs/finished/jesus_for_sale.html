<div class="lyrics">Flea Market Sunday the minivans rolling in mothers push babies in strollers, kids laughing<br />
Everyone's dressed in their best Sunday outfits all come to be cleansed from the burdens of sin<br />
<br />
The crowds have gathered they're ready for deals everyone's hungry for what they don't need<br />
Caught in the essence of business transaction lost in euphoric visions and deeds<br />
<br />
We've got what you want even though you can't tell for all of your pain, for all of your ails<br />
Inside the tent the barker is shouting out come on in, we've got Jesus for sale

<div class="chorus">Come on inside, come on inside<br />
It's dry and warm and we're really nice<br />
You'll learn to be happy and not to think twice<br />
And Jesus is always at the right price</div>

Now for a short time only down at Mickey D's get your very own Last Supper Happy Meal<br />
Includes foot washing bowl or Holy Grail all of this for only 5.53<br />
<br />
Right Guard's been changing their image and now they've got a new spokesman<br />
Jesus, arms outstretched on the cross strong enough for God, also used by humans<br />
<br />
At the site of the Holy Family Outhouse discovered first during some crusade<br />
They're selling vials of holy shit come on in, we've got Jesus for sale

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Behind prison bars rolling the dice dealing the cards, betting on fights<br />
You can be saved, be a perfect slave if you give your vices and learn to be nice<br />
<br />
A Jailhouse Christian don't smoke no rock don't do no dope, watches how he talks<br />
Ain't never been anyone more sincere another robot walking the walk<br />
<br />
You'll be here ten years or just a few more you're family's broke and you'll never make bail<br />
But that's all right you'll be happy this way â€˜cause didn't you know, we've got Jesus for sale

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

All this buying and selling all this silver and gold all these burnt sacrifices all have no point<br />
How you gonna buy something that already owns you How you gonna tell Jesus what he has, what he don't<br />
<br />
Now I'm not sure just what he would do if Jesus came back and saw all these fools<br />
I do know what happened a long time ago he cleaned house, wiped the floor with those fools<br />
<br />
What do you want with Jesus for sale you can't buy him, you can't sell him, he won't get you out of jail <br />
Don't try what Judas did, you too will fail Pick up your chips, Jesus ain't for sale

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
<div class="chords">G / C / G/ G / A7 / D<br />
