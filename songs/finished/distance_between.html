<div class="lyrics">I wanted to talk to the sea<br />
So I stood on the shore and it washed at my feet<br />
But I do not live as a sailor or saint<br />
In the realm of the honest or the reverent<br />
But the distance between<br />
<br />
The mountains were calling to me<br />
So I climbed to the top of the highest peak<br />
But I am neither mystic nor mountaineer<br />
I am all fractions and pieces of dreams<br />
And the distance between<br />
<br />
I stood at the edge of the field<br />
And tried to talk to the growing seeds<br />
But I have no farm and I cannot preach<br />
And there were no parables that I could teach<br />
Of the distance between<br />
<br />
The wind whispered through the leaves<br />
So I sat myself down underneath that tree<br />
Neither poet nor woodsman I do not see<br />
Angels in branches, the slowness of years<br />
But the distance between</div>
