<div class="lyrics">I've never known what to say about this<br />
Is it love or gravity<br />
And I've never known what to say about you<br />
Is it mere proximity<br />
But I know all too well<br />
Life with you is war<br />
The honeymoon is over<br />
The hounds are barking at the door<br />
<br />
I don't know whose orbit I'm in<br />
A planet or a black hole<br />
I don't know if I am more or less<br />
A mountain or a gorge<br />
But I know all too well<br />
There'll be time for many things<br />
Time to dwell in harmony<br />
Time to live in sin<br />
<br />
I don't know what to say about this<br />
Is it love or persistence<br />
And I don't know what to say about you<br />
Are you mine or somebody else</div>
