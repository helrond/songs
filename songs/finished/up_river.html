<div class="lyrics">I'm drifting further south every day<br />
Past Baton Rouge soon<br />
Somewhere out across the water lies<br />
A stairway to the moon<br />
<br />
I have been sailing over troubled waters<br />
Too deep for an anchor to hold<br />
I go where the trade winds want to blow<br />
Tomorrow I will be in Mexico

<div class="chorus">I'm going up the river<br />
Crossing the Atlantic, going north to south<br />
I'm going up the river<br />
I wish I could be there now</div>

I have seen visions drifting on the breeze<br />
Under a vertical sun<br />
In a place where no one sounds like me<br />
Set my feet back on solid land

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I keep one eye on the weather<br />
And my center of gravity low<br />
At the place where the waters divide<br />
There's a city of gold

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
