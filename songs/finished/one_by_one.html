<div class="lyrics">One by one things are going to fail you<br />
Going to leave you behind<br />
One by one these thoughts will desert you<br />
Leave nothing but you and the sky<br />
<br />
One by one words will betray you<br />
Excuses and reason and trust<br />
One by one your steps they will falter<br />
It will all go to dust<br />
<br />
One by one you will lose your defenses<br />
Country, language and blood<br />
One by one your fears will be conquered<br />
You will be washed in the flood<br />
<br />
Let it fall away, let it take its time<br />
Let the mountains crave the climb<br />
Rid yourself of all affection and need<br />
Cast yourself upon the mercy of the seeds<br />
<br />
One by one the rivers entwining<br />
Mountains and valleys embrace<br />
One by on there'll be clover and daisies<br />
Growing over that place</div>
