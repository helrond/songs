<div class="lyrics">When all that is left is your enemy's word<br />
And nobody else knows what you saw and heard<br />
Don't doubt yourself or your memory<br />
Or what happened there among the beasts of the field<br />
When time stood still<br />
<br />
They called you a shepherd, an ignorant youth<br />
A piper, a dancer, a leader of fools<br />
But the bishops and counts are trembling in fear<br />
Thinking of a time when these walls will disappear
When time stood still<br />

<div class="chorus">There'll be blood on the altar; they'll be dancing on drums<br />
There will be no more mysteries, only angry songs<br />
In the dancing of the spheres find the dissonant strains<br />
Make music your protector; take fire as your friend</div>

Poverty it breeds with fear<br />
The carnival takes to the city streets<br />
No time for depression, no thought for the past<br />
All of those leading become last<br />
When time stood still<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

In '76 in the winter's cold<br />
In the barren fields there bloomed a rose<br />
You went walking the borders of sanity<br />
And dreaming of justice not fantasy<br />
When time stood still

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
