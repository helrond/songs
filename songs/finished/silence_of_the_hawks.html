<div class="lyrics">Do you know that I see through your eyes<br />
December skies and concrete lies<br />
Beyond the walls of your showroom halls<br />
See it all, see it all, and down it falls<br />
<br />
Subway glances, subzero heart<br />
Don't look at me, I'm falling apart<br />
Does life happen when you're gone<br />
Anyone can see we're nearly done<br />
<br />
Don't you look, I'll go away<br />
Come back again another day<br />
Stay cool, don't act odd<br />
Same ol' life under the sword<br />
<br />
Walk in, walk out, keep on dreaming<br />
Red, white and blue, the colors screaming<br />
One day you'll get your dream house<br />
Then you'll die from the fallout</div>
