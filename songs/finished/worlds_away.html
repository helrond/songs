<div class="lyrics">If I could hold on to both your hands and tie your legs to this bed<br />
If I could lie without regrets, throw my heart into your head<br />
If I could be the jury and the judge

<div class="chorus">Still I know that I can't hold you just like I can't set you free<br />
And the only truth that matters is between you and me<br />
Still I know that I can't hold you just like you can't cling to me<br />
And the only truth that matters is the one that sets you free</div>

If I could play you like a fish hooked on the end of my line<br />
If I could say this world was for the taking that nobody really dies<br />
If I could turn your life into a song

<div class="chorus">Still I know that I can't hold you just like I can't set you free<br />
And the only truth that matters is between you and me<br />
Still I know that I can't hold you just like you can't cling to me<br />
And the only truth that matters is the one that sets you free<br />
<br />
Do you do you want to go<br />
To a land bright and fair to be walking on air<br />
Do you do you want to go<br />
To Heaven's gate to a peace worlds away</div>

If I could hold on to both your hands and tie your legs to this bed<br />
If I could walk and dance on the water turn stone into bread<br />
I'd carry you to the other shore</div>
