<div class="lyrics">Did it start when the pilgrims landed <br />
Was it somewhere in those early days<br />
Has it come lately upon us<br />
Did it start when they shot JFK<br />
<br />
Was it saving the natives from their culture<br />
Was it speaking softly and carrying a big stick<br />
Was it saving the Germans from Hitler<br />
Was it rescuing the world from the communist's grip

<div class="chorus">When did we get the high ground<br />
Does the world need a savior from itself<br />
When did we get the high ground<br />
Who will save us from ourselves</div>

Did it belong to England<br />
Did they once put on these airs<br />
Has it been ours forever<br />
Did the Russians once think it was theirs

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

And how do we keep it<br />
Do we kill more people than everyone else<br />
Long as we don't lose it<br />
I guess it won't hurt to protect ourselves

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
