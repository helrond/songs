<div class="lyrics">Because the moon can pull the ocean up on the sand<br />
Because I'd bleed for you while I still can<br />
Because I'm a fool for chemistry<br />
Because of you that's why gravity

<div class="chorus">I know there are few heavenly bodies left<br />
And apples on the tree<br />
I'd settle for an asteroid<br />
Or gravity</div>

Because trees grow up and rain falls down<br />
Because I knew I was falling before I hit the ground<br />
Because a river always runs to the sea<br />
Because of you that's why gravity

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Because inertia will always work against grace<br />
Because the only place without is outer space<br />
Because opposites attract but never agree<br />
Because of you that's why gravity

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Because the world is in orbit and I am too<br />
Because it is proven, tried and true<br />
Because you can fight but can't claim victory<br />
Because of you that's why gravity
