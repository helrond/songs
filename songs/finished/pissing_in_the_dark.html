<div class="lyrics">Back home in Tennessee life was pretty plain<br />
I'd milk the cows and feed the chickens give the horse some hay<br />
Ma cooked dinner on the stove with logs that I would split<br />
No TV, no telephones no place you couldn't spit<br />
<br />
It's true I miss my mother my farm my family<br />
But the thing I remember most is where we'd go to pee<br />
There was a shack out in the backyard with a half moon on the door<br />
It was dark and it was hard to see what you were shooting for<br />

<div class="chorus">Pissing in the dark, pissing in the dark<br />
I can't see my hands and I can't see my shoes<br />
Pissing in the dark, pissing in the dark<br />
Lord, won't you guide me, tell me where to shoot</div>

My father was a gambler and he spent his last dime<br />
On a fifth of gutrot whiskey to distract his worried mind<br />
And when the police found him below the steeple of St. Marks<br />
He had his pants around his ankles he was pissing in the dark<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Now I'm standing here in Basrah in the middle of the night<br />
A smoking gun in my left hand a grenade in my right<br />
And I screamed at my commander as the bullets â€˜round us barked<br />
This ain't a good war anymore we're pissing in the dark
