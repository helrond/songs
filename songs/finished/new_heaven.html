<div class="lyrics">In their shining ships they come from a country far beyond<br />
Searching for a new Eden<br />
With heaven on their minds, swords and bullets blessed<br />
Destiny manifest

<div class="chorus">I'm not looking for a new heaven<br />
I don't need a promised land<br />
Has this earth been given us to conquer<br />
Do we belong to the land</div>

Sifting through the smoking suburbs looking for some kind of trace<br />
Oh the accidents of arson and grace<br />
On the morning that we left we were gone without a trace<br />
And the new world was shining from your face

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Running through the city sewers beneath the cloud of smog<br />
There is writing on the wall<br />
Armageddon's seeping through every single crack<br />
The line of barges turning back

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
