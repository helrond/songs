<div class="lyrics">Otzi went out one day<br />
With a bow and arrow some deer to slay<br />
Otzi went out one day<br />
Never came back again

<div class="chorus">Otzi, oh Otzi, where have you gone<br />
Where did you wander, where did you roam<br />
Otzi, oh Otzi the iceman is gone<br />
I will keep on singing his song</div>

An enemy from behind a boulder<br />
Shot Otzi in his shoulder<br />
Left him bleeding on the ice<br />
Where he froze and lost his life

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Five thousand years later <br />
Some tourists called in the murder<br />
When the cops came on the scene <br />
What do you think they seen

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They said that's not just any old cadaver, <br />
It's a caveman and what's sadder<br />
Is he's been here 5000 years<br />
Since 3000 BC<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Now's he's stuck in this museum<br />
Locked inside of this freezer<br />
People come from everywhere<br />
Just to see him lying there

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
