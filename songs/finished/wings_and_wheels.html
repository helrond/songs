<div class="lyrics">Write me a song, sing it all day long<br />
Write me a song, sing it out<br />
Write it down, let the world know your sound<br />
Write it down, tell the world where you've been <br />
 and where you're bound<br />
<br />
Build me a ship for the stars for the seas<br />
Build me a ship for the sky<br />
Build it proud let it sail the world around<br />
Build it proud let it sail forever<br />
 never run aground<br />
<br />
Tell me a tale of knights and of whales<br />
Tell me a tale with no end<br />
Tell it now, who is lost, what you've found <br />
Tell it now, let your voice be thunder <br />
 the world, the sound<br />
<br />
Dream me a world of wings and wheels<br />
Dream me a world, make it real<br />
Dream out loud, let the universe resound<br />
Dream out loud, tell the world that this <br />
 is holy ground</div>
