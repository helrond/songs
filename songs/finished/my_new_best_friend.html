<div class="lyrics">I see people I know almost everywhere<br />
I have friends wherever I go<br />
We have done for each other the best that we can<br />
To keep out the dark and the cold

<div class="chorus">You<br />
It could be you<br />
You could be the one to defend<br />
You<br />
You could change my mind<br />
You could be my new best friend</div>

I hear the voices of my friends<br />
Everywhere that I go<br />
Their clothing and their favorite songs<br />
Become my own

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

My friends let me remember you<br />
When I am alone<br />
And dying be surrounded by<br />
Faces I know

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
