<div class="lyrics">I am waiting in the doorway with my raincoat on<br />
For you to spill your heart all over me<br />
She said to watch I don't fall into enemy hands<br />
But I am occupied territory<br />
And our armies are massing in foreign lands<br />
To strike fear in their hearts and houses<br />
She said this once was my homeland but now it has been sold<br />
Subdivided into two acre parcels<br />
<br />
All the animals that work on the graveyard shift<br />
Laugh in the face of my conviction<br />
They say I can never cure my advanced disease<br />
But I am undaunted in my mission<br />
So I've tried to guide my boat toward celestial shores<br />
Where still waters run deep<br />
But fair weather and fair winds are not a sailor's life<br />
And courage not a virtue given cheap<br />
<br />
The sad eyed sandman on the banks of the Danube<br />
Whispers in my ear it's just for fun<br />
Meanwhile I am drifting towards the water's edge<br />
Where the current is running deep and strong<br />
And Charles DeGaulle is laughing like he's back in 1940<br />
And he knows something you do not<br />
She said I am a liar she said I am a thief<br />
She said I am all I say I'm not<br />
<br />
But now I've offered up my soul to the queen of distraction<br />
She knows what to make of it<br />
She said I am the one with the devastating touch<br />
Everything I touch turns to shit<br />
You crept in with the draft on a cold winter's night<br />
This morning I shook with a fever<br />
I said Lord where've you been I've been missing you so long<br />
She said it's only one night and you were dreaming<br />
<br />
I am standing in the doorway with my raincoat on<br />
And you will spill your heart all over me<br />
She said to watch I don't fall into enemy hands<br />
But I am occupied territory</div>
