<div class="lyrics">Always one more rock in the field<br />
You can't keep ahead of the weeds<br />
And the landlord has got be paid<br />
And the weather takes its time<br />
You can't make it rain or shine<br />
You can't stop it coming down like Judgment Day

<div class="chorus">And even the mercy<br />
Even the mercy<br />
Even the mercy it burns</div>

And the margins are too slim<br />
To pay off the debt you're in<br />
It will take what you give and demand more<br />
The crops that you have grown<br />
From seeds not your own<br />
Will be gone, will be gone, will be gone<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The boss he holds the deed<br />
And the clay won't hold the seeds<br />
But you sow, and you sow, and you sow<br />
And the law is running scared<br />
Washington don't care<br />
You will get by with who you know
