<div class="lyrics">Flee the burning city and don't look back<br />
You will pass two pillars of salt that once were man and wife<br />
Flee from the ashes right into the mouth of the whale<br />
Run from the voices that tell you what is good and what is real

<div class="chorus">Run run run for your life<br />
Even Mercury's wings won't save you now<br />
Run run run for your life<br />
As fast as you can to the heart of the night</div>

Flee the beasts that tear your flesh rend you limb from limb<br />
Tell me who your devil is tell me you're not him<br />
Flee from your own heartache flee from your own soul<br />
Deny that you can have a part in humanity's whole<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Flee the long arm of the law that will uncover you<br />
Run from everything you are and everything you do<br />
Flee the good physician and the medicine of truth<br />
Go and ask the President to call in the troops
