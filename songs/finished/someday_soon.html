<div class="lyrics">Someday soon and it won't be long now<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long<br />
I'll shake these bones and clap these hands all the way to glory land<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long<br />
<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long now<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long<br />
Every thing will be revealed, there'll be no sickness or disease<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long<br />
<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long now<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long<br />
Every language, every sun, every color become one<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long<br />
<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long now<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long<br />
Time will bend and shift like sand, the waves be quieted to land<br />
Someday soon and it won't be long</div>
