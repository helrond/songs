<div class="lyrics">Corners everywhere you look, but no dead-end streets <br />
Towers and monuments; an island of dreams <br />
Where the perfect day is always half a week away<br />
Distraction never leaves, tomorrow never stays

<div class="chorus">And all of the silences, all of the sounds<br />
All of the history going down<br />
With space to grow into mercy to move<br />
Too late for primetime and too early for the news</div>

It's all about the angles, it's all about the light<br />
The tourists and their cameras, man, what's left to find <br />
Echoes of the emperors, the weight of history <br />
Vespas careening through these medieval streets

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Two globes, two palaces, two chambers and two births <br />
One for the heavens and one for the earth <br />
Motion perpetual, the span of all in one <br />
These are the threads from which a lifetime is spun

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Let us be bound for glory, you and I <br />
Minstrels and immigrants, three feet above the sky<br />
In love with silences, with sound, with everything<br />
I give it all to you my fellow citizens

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
