<div class="lyrics">You were drifting, you were blown<br />
You were out there on your own<br />
Riding lonely through the dust<br />
Red rock canyons, wind and rust<br />
<br />
You were lost in those stories told<br />
Purple sage and desert gold<br />
In the lamplight your heroes shone<br />
Past midnight they went on and on

<div class="chorus">Without fear without pride making honor your guide<br />
You rode off to that long sunrise<br />
Everybody that came they called you by name<br />
None were strangers, strangers to you</div>

You were justice served complete<br />
Judge and jury, rope and steel<br />
Always cautious with your trust<br />
Shooting only when you must

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Knew the thirst and felt the freeze<br />
And you struggled just to breathe<br />
First man in and the last one out<br />
None could fit into your coat

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
