<div class="lyrics">He's caught between the lines on the edge of this dime<br />
Took his last call at the front of the mall<br />
He's been told that his life is worth more than that<br />
And he's signed it away with a tip of his hat<br />
<br />
This crack he's slipped through has smoked him right up<br />
These lines on the highway don't tell him to stop<br />
The car horns are playing his favorite song<br />
Can't remember the name, but it's not Elton John

<div class="chorus">Go down singing</div>

His lines of sight have given him flight<br />
It's cause for redemption and divine intervention<br />
Swing down low and take him away<br />
Leave nothing behind but a cold rainy day

<div class="chorus">Go down singing</div>

You won't find him cruising the highway tonight<br />
You'll fine him where there's room to ignite<br />
Burn up the asphalt and burn up this life<br />
Burn up the world that's been holding him tight

<div class="chorus">Go down singing</div>

He's singing along to the song of his life<br />
It's spilling over the highway tonight<br />
He's finding the harmonies in his own voice<br />
Picking the colors, making the choice to

<div class="chorus">Go down singing</div></div>
<div class="chords">Am/F/G/C</div>
