<div class="lyrics">If all I wanted was to be king I would have called from Mexico<br />
If all I wanted was to be sober I would have lost you again<br />
You know I could care less to stand in defiance to watch myself losing control<br />
You know I have burned all my bridges behind me and all I have left is my soul<br />
When all it wants is truth or consequence<br />
<br />
If all I wanted was your hand I would have offered up mine<br />
If all I wanted was one more chance I would have given all that I am<br />
You know it's been easy to despise our leaders but they deserve less from me<br />
You know that the mountain can offer up secrets can whisper into your dreams<br />
That all it wants is truth or consequence

<div class="chorus">We may watch the mountains crumble and fall into the ocean if we have eyes to see<br />
We may see the desert blossom and rivers swell with tears if we have eyes to see<br />
We may listen to the roar of this sweet flood of freedom if we have ears to hear<br />
We may proclaim freedom to the chains and the captives if we have mouths to speak<br />
Saying all we want is truth or consequence</div>

If all I wanted was heaven on earth I would have called an airstrike in<br />
If all I wanted was my own freedom I would have gone in for all I'm worth<br />
You know it's been easy to turn peace to treason to turn loyalty to hate<br />
You know that power is not mine to give but it is yours to take<br />
But all I want is truth or consequence</div>
