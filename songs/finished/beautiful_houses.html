<div class="lyrics">Who is left to follow anymore<br />
For an answer who is there to call<br />
Monuments and altars, what are they for<br />
But fallacies waiting to fall

<div class="chorus">And the people are building and the house it is strong<br />
Windows pulsating with light<br />
The music and laughter it goes on and on<br />
In those beautiful houses through the night</div>

Every farmer leaves his lines in the field<br />
Geometry, chaos and time<br />
I am just a tenant on this land of these seeds<br />
But the cultivation is mine

<div class="chorus">CHORUS<br />
<br />
At the threshold, bending down<br />
Left my shoes at the door<br />
Finding balance in each step<br />
On uneven floors</div>

Architects and draftsmen; we are residents<br />
Beggars and saints<br />
Only by the strength of our sowing and praise<br />
Will Paradises be made

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
