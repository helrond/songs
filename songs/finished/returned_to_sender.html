<div class="lyrics">At 4 am it's time to fly<br />
Put on your coat but leave this suitcase standing by<br />
Let these possessions pass you by<br />
You'll never need them in the sweet bye and bye<br />
<br />
No time to pack your life away<br />
One chance is all you get, at least that's what they say<br />
More than throwing it away<br />
You'll never need it in the place you're going to stay

<div class="chorus">And out of here he'll fly<br />
Out of the weight of darkness fallen from his mind<br />
And out of here he'll fly<br />
Upward past the little hells he has left behind</div>

Onwards, upwards pushing in<br />
All the lives that haunt him still won't let him in<br />
Another way to start again<br />
Another life to live to show us what has been<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

No destinations to approach<br />
Maybe he'll pass beyond the ends of this rope<br />
Beneath the arching leaves of hope<br />
Will lean to rest and hear the sweet sound below

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
<div class="chords">Em / Cadd9 / Dsus2<br />
Em / Cadd9 / Bdim7<br />
<br />
Em / G / Cadd9<br />
Em / G / D</div>
