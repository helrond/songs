<div class="lyrics">I'm not a man who's been so far away that I've lost all allegiance to home<br />
I'm not a man who's had so many names that I have forgotten my own<br />
I am the immigrant I am the abdicant I am the prodigal son<br />
I am the man of many ways but I still know the path to my home<br />
<br />
I'm not a man who's been so far from land that I've fallen in love with the sea<br />
I'm not a man who's seen so many wonders I'm blind to the marvel of peace<br />
I am the song and I am the singer I am the minor key<br />
I am a man who has lived on these waters but I must be leaving the sea

<div class="chorus">Bring me my gold my arrow my bow <br />
A star to steer me true<br />
This is my story my honor my glory<br />
Now I am going home</div>

I'm not a man who's been so many people that I've lost a claim to my soul<br />
I'm not a man who's been so long a stranger that my feet do not turn toward home <br />
I am the captain I am the anchor I am the billowing sail<br />
I am the man of many faces but I've not forgotten my soul</div>
