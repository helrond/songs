<div class="lyrics">Burn my eyes with a holy fire let me see all things anew<br />
Burn my eyes with a holy fire let me learn to love the truth<br />
Though I walk through storms and shadows I shall not be moved<br />
Burn my eyes with a holy fire let me see all things renewed<br />
 <br />
Wash my hands with holy water let them be at work always<br />
Wash my hands with holy water let them never long to stray<br />
To my poor, my friends, my neighbors, enemies extend<br />
Wash my hands with holy water let their work be yours always<br />
 <br />
Set my feet on paths of glory let them walk on holy ground<br />
Set my feet on paths of glory let them be upward bound<br />
Let them take me to the place where all will be revealed<br />
Set my feet on paths of glory let this all be holy ground<br />
<br />
Burn my tongue with coals of fire let me speak of distant shores<br />
Burn my tongue with coals of fire let my words always be yours<br />
In the wideness of your presence learn to keep my peace<br />
Burn my tongue with coals of fire  bring me safely ashore<br />
<br />
Break my heart with holy wisdom let me learn to love again<br />
Break my heart with holy wisdom let me on your strength depend<br />
And the power past all knowing clothed in sacrifice<br />
Break my heart with holy wisdom let me long for you again</div>
