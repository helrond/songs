<div class="lyrics">Here<br />
I look to find you<br />
There <br />
And here and back again<br />
<br />
Where <br />
Were you when she breathed her last<br />
How<br />
Could you tell me it's worth what's past<br />
<br />
Is there another way to show what it's like to die so slow<br />
Is there another way to see this price of being free

<div class="chorus">Meet me halfway to Baghdad<br />
Meet me halfway where the ocean meets the sky<br />
Meet me halfway to Baghdad<br />
Meet me halfway to the tears I have to cry</div>

Where<br />
Were you when heaven rained fire<br />
Why <br />
Does the truth just stoke the fire<br />
<br />
Give yourself a chance to take more than a glance<br />
Give yourself the peace to know you're not asleep

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

If<br />
I gave you the chance to go and see<br />
Would <br />
You finally hear me<br />
<br />
Your churches have no windows, but our graveyards have eyes<br />
Your churches have no windows, but our gravestones don't lie
