<div class="lyrics">The morning after<br />
Across the street there's a shrine<br />
The corner store's got a new awning<br />
And the sun finally decided to shine<br />
<br />
And there's some crazy evangelist saying<br />
Bridgeport, Jesus loves you<br />
And the newspapers got a couple of lines<br />
A lot of people don't know what to do

<div class="chorus">Just how many bullets<br />
How many kids is it going to take<br />
How many more obituaries<br />
Before we see what's at stake</div>

The kids at the school two blocks from here<br />
What do they think when they walk by that corner<br />
Do they know, are they scared, do they want to shoot back<br />
Is life just like death, you gotta die to be born

<div class="chorus">Got a big army<br />
Got a lot of guns<br />
But you can't stop the river<br />
Of blood from our daughters and sons</div>

A thousand years from now<br />
Will we all be higher off the ground<br />
Will cars fly and houses change color<br />
Or will we all be six feet down<br />
<br />
Just how many bullets<br />
How many kids is it going to take<br />
How many more obituaries<br />
Before we see what's at stake</div>
