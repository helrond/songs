<div class="lyrics">Sterilized halls, immaculate lawns<br />
Programmed minds, go above and beyond<br />
We've got all our trash behind the gate<br />
Regular pick-ups at quarter to eight

<div class="chorus">Sometimes the trash can just overflows<br />
Something slips out, can't find where it goes<br />
Sometimes people, well, they just have a will<br />
Catch them soon, or we'll all see your road kill</div>

Secret documents, nope, they're all gone<br />
Torture manuals, what are you on<br />
Our soldiers are good, honest and true<br />
Even if sometimes we lose a few

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

He was a soldier, good, honest and true<br />
His mind, well, he must have lost a few<br />
He chose to live out on the street<br />
I'm telling you man, he was really beat<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When he came back, we shot him up<br />
Who needs those bums and their cups<br />
We forgot, for once, to clean up our mess<br />
And now it's news all over the U.S.

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
