<div class="lyrics">The sunrise from the top of the mountain<br />
The monarch drifting down the valley’s edge<br />
The silence that breaks on me like thunder<br />
If only I had words to say<br />
<br />
Every one of all my deepest secrets<br />
And all the knowledge yet to be revealed<br />
All my friends and all of my lovers<br />
If only I had words to say<br />
<br />
The things that bring me laughter and tears<br />
My part to play here on this spinning world<br />
The things that I believe in without seeing<br />
If only I had words to say<br />
<br />
The motion in each word of every language<br />
The color and the shape in every sound<br />
The dancing lines of every human being<br />
If only I had words to say</div>
