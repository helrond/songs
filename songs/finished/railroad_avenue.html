<div class="lyrics">When I stepped into the rain on that cold November night<br />
My hands were in my pockets, my eyes were quick and bright<br />
You're a sailor said the Englishman, but Lord what's in your pants<br />
Oh, I know it's not ants<br />
I did not reply, for I knew what was said<br />
That the captains of industry heard every word<br />
But I've been busted and battered man, I have been abused<br />
I'm mystified and confused

<div class="chorus">So I asked him who devised this game, who shot the sheriff, who was to blame<br />
He said what you have heard is true they'll crucify you <br />
On Railroad Avenue</div>

She was thinking of the captain as she put on her face<br />
But Smiling Jenny knew the admiral was lying in wait<br />
She was moaning for a reason to strengthen her will<br />
For a sailor down in Mobile<br />
She turned from her mirror as I walked in<br />
Said I to Jenny, I don't like the way you grin<br />
Oh sonny boy you've got a lot to learn <br />
She said while my conscience burned

<div class="chorus">How high's the water, momma, where is the past, well it's five feet high and rising fast<br />
Say one more word my boy and they will bury you<br />
On Railroad Avenue</div>

Mother Mary, said the ladybug, I'm flying from home<br />
There's a coroner's convention down in San Antone<br />
A shot of compassion to free me of my sins<br />
Half a year, a fifth of gin<br />
<br />
I've got mouths to feed I've got bills to pay<br />
Said the train conductor as he walked away<br />
Who's that stirring who's in my bed<br />
I thought you were cold and dead

<div class="chorus">Call me the jester, call me the maid, call John Henry back from the grave <br />
You can find all that you need but not one single grain of truth<br />
On Railroad Avenue<br />
Call me a liar, call me a fool, a double agent, the hope of youth<br />
You could get picked up, t-boned, curled, turn black and blue<br />
On Railroad Avenue</div></div>
