<div class="lyrics">As a blue eyed boy of almost ten I<br />
Went down by the train<br />
A hobo's life I planned as I<br />
Put pennies on the rails<br />
Steel on steel<br />
Boxcars and wheels<br />
<br />
The bus I took away from there<br />
It stopped in every town<br />
And I found a place without a plan<br />
My work was in my home<br />
Nothing but dreams<br />
Left up to me

<div class="chorus">Everything wants to be free<br />
Except what you love and what you need<br />
All alone without words or deeds<br />
Spring comes quietly</div>

Lacking courage and direction I<br />
Sat down upon the shore<br />
Wanting nowhere to belong and no more<br />
Turnstiles or doors<br />
Seconds or signs<br />
Landmarks or lines

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Yesterday at half past ten I<br />
I went down by the train<br />
Where I stood without reception, laid it<br />
Down upon the rails<br />
Forgot my path<br />
My debts and maps<br />
