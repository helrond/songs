<div class="lyrics">When I woke up it was raining<br />
I heard the sound of a wet street outside<br />
When I woke up I felt clean again<br />
Felt good enough to take on three days at a time<br />
<br />
Over on Park Street someone just died<br />
Shot in the head on a Saturday night<br />
The cops chased some kid around<br />
No one's any wiser about it now<br />
<br />
The pews are empty except for a few<br />
And I want to be wrong about you<br />
You want protection and I understand<br />
But how can you save what you don't command<br />
<br />
Could you hear the shots - at night<br />
Would you walk down that street - alone<br />
How do you know when to get out<br />
What do you do when a deal goes down<br />
<br />
When I fell asleep it was raining<br />
Rain streaked the window, cars drove by<br />
Tell me, do you feel clean now<br />
Are you living so that others can die</div>
