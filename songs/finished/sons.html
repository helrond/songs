<div class="lyrics">At the foot of the cross Mary weeps for her son<br />
He's dying young, he's dying slow<br />
She's thinking back on how boys grow<br />
And we still kill our mother's sons<br />
In front of the TV set a father weeps for his son<br />
He's dying young, he's dying jailed<br />
He's thinking back on how he's failed<br />
And we still kill our father's sons

<div class="chorus">What have we done to our beloved sons<br />
Is this war lost or is it just begun<br />
For now we see in part but then face to face<br />
Now we are under law but then it will be grace</div>

A son full of the Holy Ghost, a son full of the devil<br />
A son, friend of whores and thieves, a son a rebel<br />
A mother, wife and seamstress, a father a union man<br />
We still kill our mother's sons<br />
A mother host to angels, a father demonized<br />
A son who turns the tables, a son of freedom denied<br />
Years between and what has changed since this began<br />
We still kill our father's sons

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Two sons who came to claim their birthright<br />
Two sons who burn within our hearts<br />
Two sons not many of chose to hear either one<br />
We still kill our mother's sons<br />
Two sons with mothers, fathers, brothers<br />
Two sons sent off to the slaughter<br />
Two more parents left to mourn the death of their beloved ones<br />
We still kill our father's sons
