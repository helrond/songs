<div class="lyrics">It's skin and bones but it kicks like a mule and<br />
It'll carry my pack my rifle my boots<br />
Left on my dime my senses behind<br />
Digging for dreams in Jackson mine

<div class="chorus">California bound<br />
Futures there to be found<br />
Go west young man there's gold in the hills<br />
Of California</div>

It's the Central Pacific 508<br />
And it'll take me due west to San Jose<br />
Over Chinese bones John Henry's steel<br />
An open door and a turn of the wheel

<div class="chorus">California bound<br />
Futures there to be found<br />
I don't believe from here the birds fly south in winter<br />
From California</div>

It's got a shake and a rattle but it's still gonna roll<br />
And half a tank will get me to Sacramento<br />
From there it's all downhill until I hit the sea<br />
The Hollywood hills the silver screen

<div class="chorus">California bound<br />
Futures there to be found<br />
I'll take the endless miles the wind in my hair<br />
To California</div>

I've got a voice and I know it ain't mine<br />
I've got a roving eye and a distracted mind<br />
I'm a leaky boat a plane without wings<br />
I'm not doing too bad with just paper and string

<div class="chorus">California bound<br />
Futures there to be found<br />
I'm just like anyone I want what is forbidden<br />
California<br />
I'm just like anyone I want to be forgiven<br />
California</div></div>
