<div class="lyrics">
At Hiroshima<br />
there's a museum,<br />
and outside that museum<br />
there's a rock,<br />
and on that rock there's a shadow.<br />
<br />
That shadow<br />
is all that remains<br />
of the human being who stood there<br />
on the sixth of August in 45<br />
At the dawn of the nuclear age.<br />
<br />
That is the choice before us.<br />
In reality, that is our time.<br />
We shall either end all war <br />
and the specter of nuclear arms <br />
<br />
in our own lifetimes, <br />
or we well all become<br />
<br />
shadows<br />
on the rock.</div>
