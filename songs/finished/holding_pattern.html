I got my left hand down and I'm waiting for that call<br />
I am tuned to the static, I am waiting for that call<br />
Maintaining altitude until I run out of fuel<br />
I can only wait on that call<br />

<div class="chorus">
And he says hold on<br />
Just a little longer son<br />
We'll get you safely down, just take another turn around<br />
There is a right way for things to be done</div>

I've grown tired as hell waiting for that call<br />
But I can't sleep because I'm waiting for that call<br />
My stomach's rumbling, but I can't eat a thing<br />
All I can do is wait on that call<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I've got a buzzing mind and I'm waiting for that call<br />
And a twitching eye because I'm waiting for that call<br />
Could be headed east or west, the sun don't rise and it never sets<br />
Take another swing around and wait on that call<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
