<div class="lyrics">Only two things you can't avoid in life, death and taxes<br />
My father rocked, I sat on his knee, it was a day slow as molasses<br />
Lazarus pulled up a chair and sat facing Texas<br />
He started to talk as soft as snow in a voice like broken glass<br />
<br />
There are two roads in life said he that you must choose between<br />
Be careful, though, for often things are not what they seem<br />
The road of life leads to an altar many fall upon<br />
The road to freedom leads to jail in Babylon

<div class="chorus">You grant immortality I said, what can I do<br />
He said you've nothing that I need but give if you want to</div>

You can scream until your throat is blood at the way the world goes round<br />
But gravity waits for no man and time pulls us all down<br />
It matters not if you go to war or join the inquisition<br />
What matters is that you praise the Lord and pass the ammunition<br />
<br />
But, said I, you don't pretend to run the underground<br />
No, he said, but I can call the thunder down<br />
Loose the bonds of servitude the cops await with cuffs<br />
You can turn and run like Johnny done try to bluff

<div class="chorus">And on the road you'll find yourself lured by many snares<br />
But don't cry for the children they can do that for themselves</div>

Only two things you can't avoid in life, death and taxes<br />
My father rocked, I sat on his knee it was a day slow as molasses<br />
The wind whispered through the fields, the sky grew dark and gray<br />
My father spat, crossed his legs and said it looks like rain</div>
<div class="chords">Verse: D/A/C/G<br />
