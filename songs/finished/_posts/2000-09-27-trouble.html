Trouble went walking out of town and walked right to Virginia<br />
Sat down in a cell in correctional hell and tapped a shoulder with his finger<br />
Talked to the mind in a way that was kind and the boy couldn't stop him, he said<br />
Boy don't you want to be free, oh boy don't you want to be free<br />
<br />
Inmates don't make the laws that send the congressmen to jail<br />
Beggars can't be choosers and justice never fails<br />
Did he hang, was he hung, did he do it, was it done â€“ the dead can't answer<br />
Boy, don't you want to be free, oh boy don't you want to be free<br />
<br />
Kill the lies and kill the law, kill all of those who saw<br />
Kill your heart and kill yourself, kill for your mental health<br />
Kill my heart and kill me, you can't kill what murder makes us be<br />
Boy, don't you want to be free, oh boy don't you want to be free<br />
<br />
Trouble jumped ship and headed out west where he heard the days were longer<br />
Sat himself down in another part of town and started this all over<br />
It won't be long, he's just been gone, and the broken record plays again<br />
Boy, don't you want to be free, oh boy don't you want to be free
