Take what you can carry<br />
Leave the rest behind<br />
There's no sense to even worry<br />
Age is nothing but time

<div class="chorus">Permanence is fiction<br />
You must spend what you save<br />
I have learned no convictions<br />
It will all pass away</div>

I am a keeper<br />
Arranging hope<br />
In the currency of paper<br />
A dealer gone broke

<div class="chorus">CHORUS<br />
<br />
When you write it down<br />
Please remember me<br />
Every line and phrase<br />
Is a mystery</div>

If all of my savings<br />
Outweighed the cost<br />
The interest gathered<br />
Served to save the lost

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Take what you can carry<br />
Leave the rest behind<br />
There's no sense to even worry<br />
Age is nothing but time
