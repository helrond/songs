It was a beautiful night when you walked away from me and I swore I would never forget<br />
Your finger on my lips and my heart in your mouth and you already turning away<br />
You said love has made us lie love has made us terrified love must bow to fate<br />
It was a beautiful night when you walked away from me<br />
You were just practicing freedom<br />
<br />
When you signed the order and called out the soldier bearing a lock and key<br />
You thought it would be a sign to tame the haughty and teach the conquered peace<br />
The crowd outside chants for truth chants for democracy chants for the king of thieves<br />
And signing the order and calling out the soldier<br />
You were just practicing freedom<br />
<br />
There was blood on the wall there was screaming in the hall and you said so this is war<br />
There were pictures in the paper excuses on the radio and your good name on the floor<br />
Now all the king's horses and all the king's men can't put reality back together again<br />
The blood on the wall the screaming in the hall<br />
You were just practicing freedom<br />
<br />
It was a beautiful night when you walked away from me and I swore I would never forget<br />
The way you turned away from me surrendered quietly saying here I am<br />
And knowing what it would mean the flogging and the tree the sacrificial lamb<br />
It was a beautiful night when you walked away from me<br />
But you were just practicing freedom
