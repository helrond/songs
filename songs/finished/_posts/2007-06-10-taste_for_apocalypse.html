From the shake shake shimmy of your hips<br />
I could tell you had a taste for the apocalypse<br />
And oh my Lord, what could I do?<br />
Got a hot old time, got a fancy freeze<br />
A muscleheaded mama down in New Orleans<br />
And oh my Lord, what could I do?

<div class="chorus">Home and all I wanted<br />
Home and all I wanted<br />
Home and all I wanted here</div>

In the crackling wind the heavy blows<br />
The thunder and the lightning and the falling snow<br />
Oh my Lord, I am through!<br />
Don't hold on to that ace too long<br />
When the weatherman's got the odds all wrong<br />
Oh my Lord, I am through!

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Your golden voice and your smoky eyes<br />
The calming smog and sunny skies<br />
Oh my Lord, those words came true!<br />
From your iron mouth and your spinning wheels<br />
And all the shame that you just don't feel<br />
Oh my Lord, those words came true!

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I could learn the secrets of your soul<br />
If you take me as your Barbie doll<br />
Oh my Lord, what can I do?<br />
We could stretch it out and let it ride<br />
I could be the Bonnie to your Clyde<br />
Oh my Lord, what can I do?
