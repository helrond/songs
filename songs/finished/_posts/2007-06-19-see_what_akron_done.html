I've been up and I've been down<br />
And I've blown through every town<br />
Now I'm crawling on my knees<br />
See what Akron done to me<br />
<br />
I've been into every place<br />
And made all kinds of mistakes<br />
All the cops, the guns, the beers<br />
See what Akron done to me<br />
<br />
I've known trouble, I've known pain<br />
And I've known the worst of ways<br />
How broke and cold a man can be<br />
See what Akron done to me<br />
<br />
Now I've burned up every cent<br />
All my dreams are gone and spent<br />
In the rain at half past three<br />
See what Akron done to me<br />
<br />
My good friends, look at me<br />
Lying broken on this street<br />
All the rubber, all the steel<br />
See what Akron done to me
