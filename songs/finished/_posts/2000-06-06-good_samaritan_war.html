The road up north to a New Jerusalem<br />
Angels scream for the blood of men<br />
Rocks have ears, stones have eyes<br />
Sun in eyes in falling skies<br />
<br />
He was thirsty he had fallen among thieves<br />
Sweat on his face, dirt on his knees<br />
And then the red Chevy comes<br />
The Good Samaritan pulls out a gun

<div class="chorus">It used to be you were just ignored<br />
Now you're shot at and destroyed</div>

Twenty-two years shot, bleeding to death<br />
Don't dream for more than second best<br />
The man who shot him pulls over, stops<br />
“It's just a trespassing Mexican, call the cops”

<div class="chorus">It used to be you were just ignored<br />
Now you're shot at and destroyed<br />
<br />
Hey, hey everybody run<br />
The Good Samaritan's got a gun<br />
Hey, hey what's the score<br />
Who's winning the Good Samaritan War</div>

South of the Border, American investments<br />
Work ten hours a day for fifty cents<br />
Up north, the Good American<br />
Thinks he's the Good Samaritan

<div class="chorus">Don't look at me like that, it's not my fault<br />
At least now, they have a job<br />
<br />
CHORUS</div>

Call the name of war, call slavery<br />
The horsemen ride again against the tree<br />
Heaven rains down blood and fire<br />
Smoke curls from crumbling empires
