The market's got the bulls running again and<br />
I'm too tired to run<br />
I turn around to face the dust and the hooves<br />
Looking down the barrel of a gun<br />
<br />
Mortgage payments credit card debts<br />
I've looked into their eyes<br />
Phone bills hone your skills and simon says<br />
Kiss my ass goodbye

<div class="chorus">Onwards forwards upwards outwards I'll take the highway over your way<br />
If I drive this far tonight you'll never find me<br />
Buy sell trade and go to hell don't pass go just go to jail<br />
If I lose myself tonight you'll never find me</div>

They say always go up<br />
Have you ever looked down from the top<br />
When the elevator's stuck<br />
Do you take the stairs and when do you stop

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Can't push me off can't pull me back<br />
At least this one thing is gonna be mine<br />
Standing fifty stories up<br />
The wind is blowing saying this could be the time<br />
<br />
If I jump I'm not gonna fall<br />
The chains and greedy paper ghosts blow away<br />
If I jump I'm not gonna scream<br />
Tomorrow the headline's gonna say

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
