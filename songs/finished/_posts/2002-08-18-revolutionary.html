You said you had visions of paradise and knowledge of where we'd been<br />
Then you go walking away on water and leave us to sink or swim<br />
You said you were granted foresight and you knew the fires of hell<br />
Then you go walking away to the bright side saying it's just as well<br />
<br />
You said that all your actions were true and mostly you have lost<br />
You said you were called to be faithful and not a success<br />
You said that times were getting hard and only would get worse<br />
Then you go turning away from here denying your place of birth<br />
<br />
You say you want peace but when it comes it bores you stiff<br />
Then you go walking the road less traveled and saying that joy is a cliff <br />
You said that things were this way forever and will be again next year<br />
Then you go turning wine to water and saying the end is near
