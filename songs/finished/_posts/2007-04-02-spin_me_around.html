Silence is a place where you go all alone<br />
The mirror in the hallway, a broken telephone<br />
Where all of the absence and misplaced intentions don't seem too much to hold<br />
Silence is a place and you go there alone

<div class="chorus">Spin me around drop that needle down<br />
You've got to find a way to say what you've got to say</div>

Silence is a place where you go when there's nowhere else<br />
The drawbridge to your refuge, the last line of defense<br />
The battlements erected by the weight of the unsaid<br />
Silence is a place when there's nowhere else

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Silence is a place where you go with those you love<br />
The language of perfection, the element of trust<br />
Wider than the ocean, deeper than the sky<br />
Silence is a place and you go there in love

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">D/A/Bm/G/A<br />
D/A/Bm/G/A<br />
G/A/D/A/Bm<br />
G/A/Bm/G/D/A/D<br />
<br />
G/D/A</div>
