Twenty miles from the nearest headlight the darkness cuts into my brain<br />
And the line between reality and dreams blurs and twists and fades<br />
I dream of violent death I dream of smoking steel shattered glass<br />
Exit wounds blood red runs and things I won't confess<br />
<br />
I've got the hammer down and the overdrive on<br />
Running on the memories of places I have known<br />
And the lines on the highway don't seem so straight anymore<br />
And the smoke on the horizon is something we just can't ignore

<div class="chorus">Hey America who's your savior now<br />
Hey America can you see the sky falling down<br />
Is it too late tonight to wake up from the American Dream<br />
Is it too late is there only time to scream</div>

The demons are running wild tonight through graveyards of defeat<br />
They've surfaced to feed on the fresh young blood running through our streets<br />
All across this shining land weapons are drawn<br />
Guns and knives and billyclubs for the strike at dawn<br />
<br />
Then the drunken homicide detective staggers in our of the rain<br />
Pours himself a strong one and says he died in vain<br />
The kids that weren't drafted are fighting with the cops<br />
The soldiers stagger home from the front no one really wants this to stop

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The Generals are marching back to their underground bunkers<br />
The dancing girl wants just one thing his head on a platter<br />
The jets dropping body bags rumble low overhead <br />
And the president is casting a powerful spell<br />
<br />
The Vietnam Veteran is screaming naked on his porch in the rain<br />
His daughter asked me how to get home and I said he could explain<br />
Kiss me my love as I waltz off to war I'll be back before you know it<br />
All in one piece and when I'm released I won't even show it

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Verse:<br />
Em / open / Em / G / D<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
G / Em / C / D (2x)<br />
Em / C / G / D (2x)</div>
