Walking on the side on my way down the road<br />
To heaven<br />
Stuck on a face hanging out of a window<br />
Skeptical grin<br />
<br />
Said son you've got a good heart<br />
But a weak head<br />
All those crazy dictators will kill us<br />
If we're not prepared

<div class="chorus">What is it about genocide<br />
What about the bigger lies<br />
What is it about suicide<br />
That's worth the price</div>

The cradle of civilization cracked<br />
Babylon's fallen<br />
All the dictators and government leaders<br />
Can't fix it again

<div class="chorus">What you say is going to last<br />
What you see is not the past<br />
What you hear is not the last<br />
Of this song

Wave your flag and march around<br />
Waive your right to higher ground<br />
What about your salvation <br />
It's not free</div>
