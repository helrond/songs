I don't need a plane ticket to fly<br />
I don't need a mountain to reach the sky<br />
I don't need an obituary<br />
I don't need a river to reach the sea<br />
<br />
How did you let your mind die<br />
How did your eyes go blind<br />
How did your fingers go numb<br />
How did you pale under the sun

<div class="chorus">Everybody knows the signs<br />
Nobody will be there sometimes<br />
Nobody tries to die and<br />
Everybody tries not to try</div>

I don't need a plane ticket to fly<br />
I don't need a mountain to reach the sky<br />
I don't need an obituary<br />
I don't need a river to reach the sea
