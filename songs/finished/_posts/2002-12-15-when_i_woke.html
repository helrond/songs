When I woke you were closer when I woke you were near<br />
When I woke the clouds had lifted and the hurricane was here<br />
When I woke I saw the rainbow touch down on my bed<br />
When I woke the heavens opened but it was not raining bread

<div class="chorus">How can you say you love someone when you don't know their name<br />
How can you tell your heart to bleed when it don't feel no shame<br />
How can you say you want me when you don't know where I've been<br />
How can I say I won't go there again</div>

When I woke I was a liar when I woke I was playing the fool<br />
When I woke I found the promised land under foreign rule<br />
When I woke I was a sinner when I woke I was a saint<br />
When I woke I found the canvas was no thicker than the paint

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When I woke I was a millionaire when I woke up I was broke<br />
When I woke I drank that finest wine it only made me choke<br />
When I woke I was a peasant when I woke I was a king<br />
When I woke I ruled the devil but I couldn't talk to him

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">D/A/D/A<br />
D/A/G/A<br />
D/A/D/A<br />
D/A/G/A<br />
<br />
G/A/D/G<br />
G/A/D/G<br />
G/A/D/G<br />
A/D</div>
