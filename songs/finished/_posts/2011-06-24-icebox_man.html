I work in a refrigerator, I am your ice box man
I work in a refrigerator, I am an ice box man
When I touch you honey, can't even feel my hands

I've got dirty fingers and I've got dirty hands
Yeah I've got dirty fingers yeah I've got dirty hands
I try and wash them but they're so filthy, man

My teeth are rattling, my toes are blocks of ice
My teeth are rattling, my toes are blocks of ice
I love you baby, keep me warm at night

I've got icicles dangling off my ears
Yeah I've got icicles dangling off my ears
I need some fire, baby, I need some body heat

I work in a refrigerator, I am your ice box man
I work in a refrigerator, I am an ice box man
When I touch you honey, can't even feel my hands
