They'll be lurking in the shadows every time you turn your back<br />
In wingtips and threepiece suits and spotless bowler hats<br />
And a whisper in the alley leads off the evening news<br />
Every word you've spoken being turned back on you

<div class="chorus">Something on you, something on you<br />
Somewhere there's a man watching your every move<br />
Something on you, something on you<br />
Somewhere there's a man who has something to lose</div>

They'll listen in to every call at any time of day<br />
They'll get it down on paper, they'll get it down on tape<br />
In a basement around the corner or a van just down the block<br />
There will be a recording every time you talk

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They'll shine it in your face, put your civil rights on hold<br />
Asking questions with answers they already know<br />
And if you spill your guts or play it close to the vest<br />
It will end up in a memo on the Director's desk

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">
Am/C//G<br />
F//C/G<br />
Am/C//G<br />
F//C/G<br />
<br />
F/C/Am/G<br />
F/C/Am/G<br />
F/C/Am/G<br />
F/C/G/C</div>
