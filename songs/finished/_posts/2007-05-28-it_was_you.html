It was not the rain that made me stay<br />
It was you<br />
It was not the sun that brightened my day<br />
It was you<br />
Not the famine, not the drought<br />
The flood that covered Ararat<br />
None of these turned me inside out<br />
But you<br />
<br />
It was not this city that captured me<br />
It was you<br />
Not fame or fortune that set me free<br />
It was you<br />
Not the traffic not the night<br />
Not one of those flashing lights<br />
None of these have set me right<br />
But you<br />
<br />
It was not the rain that made me stay<br />
It was you<br />
It was not the sun that brightened my day<br />
It was you<br />
Not the famine, not the drought<br />
The flood that covered Ararat<br />
None of these turned me inside out<br />
But you
