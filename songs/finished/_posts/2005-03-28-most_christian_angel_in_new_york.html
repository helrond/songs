It's hard to stay holy in this city of sin and I'm not saying I've done it well<br />
I've done my share of drinking, drugging and screwing but not enough to send me to hell<br />
Pour the next round and I'll tell you another of the things I have seen in this town<br />
And running around trying to keep out the devil has run me right into the ground

<div class="chorus">Lift me up I am tired, I am weary<br />
I am weak I am worn<br />
Lift me up it is not easy<br />
Being the most Christian angel in New York</div>

I'm not saying I am holy and righteous, but I have done better than most<br />
Fronting my punk band - you might have seen us - called the Heavenly Host<br />
Those cherubim and seraphim, well I saw them tagging walls and jacking up cars<br />
Gabriel's lying in his puke in the gutter on the Bowery and Michael's got three hookers on each arm

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I'm tired of this profession; it always seems I'm saving the ugly and the dumb<br />
I just checked my contract and I didn't see a clause denying natural selection<br />
So if your pipes leak and your rent is outrageous, your neighbor deals, your roommate steals your beer <br />
Take your complaints to the upstairs office; don't blame me, I just work here

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/D/C/D/G<br />
<br />
C/G/D/G</div>
