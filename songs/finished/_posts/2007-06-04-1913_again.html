Do you recall, do you remember<br />
What happened on that day in December<br />
This was our country, my friend<br />
This was our land<br />
<br />
That Christmas Eve, tears were shed<br />
And the blood of the innocent<br />
Fifty-nine children paid the price<br />
When someone shouted fire<br />

<div class="chorus">For everywhere a memory is stolen<br />
Everywhere the hidden is revealed<br />
And everywhere a heart is broken by a song<br />
It's 1913 again</div>

It's a debt you will never clear<br />
When you're paid by the company<br />
When they own the ground underneath your feet<br />
You owe them your memories<br />
<br />
How do you keep it together<br />
When your neighbor is a killer<br />
You cast a web that diffuses shame<br />
And misplace all of the blame<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Do you recall, do you remember<br />
What happened on that day in December<br />
Do you believe in the past my friend<br />
Do you believe in the past<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
