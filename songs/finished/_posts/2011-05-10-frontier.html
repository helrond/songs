Where I stood there was water as far as I could see<br />
It was not the ocean but man it could have been<br />
And I was thinking of the places where the horizon curls<br />
Riverbeds and cities named after saints and girls

<div class="chorus">I want to stand at the border<br />
In a place where they don't know me<br />
I want to make it on the frontier<br />
Where I can let it out and let it be</div>

I climbed up the hill and left my stones in a heap<br />
One by one I  brought them there to lift up the peak<br />
And I was thinking of the essence, I was thinking of the cost<br />
Thinking of finding one more way to get lost

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

As a boy a dreamt of riding out on the western plains<br />
Now I pass through turnstiles almost every single day<br />
And at every border crossing you'll find these questions there<br />
Where you've been, who you met, if you have something to declare

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/Em/D/G<br />
G/Em/C/D<br />
G/Em/D/G<br />
G/Em/D/G<br />
<br />
C/G<br />
G/D<br />
C/G<br />
G/D/C/G</div>
