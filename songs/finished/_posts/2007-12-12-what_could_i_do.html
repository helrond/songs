What could I do<br />
I took you at your word<br />
Trying my best to belong<br />
What could I do<br />
What could I do<br />
I was wrong<br />
<br />
What could I do<br />
I was not myself and<br />
Outnumbered five to one<br />
What could I do<br />
What could I do<br />
I was so gone<br />
<br />
What could I do<br />
Being less than kind<br />
A lesson learned so well<br />
What could I do<br />
What could I do<br />
I was bored as hell<br />
<br />
What could I do<br />
Without knowing my faults<br />
With no grounds for confidence<br />
What could I do<br />
What could I do<br />
I have no defense
