If a baptism by fire costs as much as water<br />
If a drowning man can learn to swim<br />
If one more drop will push you over<br />
Then I just might be your cup's brim<br />
<br />
If a bishop's head is served upon a platter<br />
If a dog can enter church through open doors<br />
And if the word goes forth so does justice<br />
And the truth cuts like a two edged sword

<div class="chorus">Oh Babylon do you know you're through<br />
When will you learn of your fall<br />
Oh Babylon turn again and live<br />
Surrender all</div>

If their total sum exceeds all of your number<br />
If a prophet can be swallowed whole and live<br />
If all you can see are the legal implications<br />
They'll go slipping through your fingers like a sieve <br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

If the body cannot keep a bone from breaking<br />
If the heart cannot keep the mind in one piece<br />
If the fear on the face of the campesino<br />
Is in the eyes of a dog crushed on the street<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/Am/G<br />
Am/C/G<br />
<br />
Am/Em/F/C<br />
F/G/C<br />
Am/Em/C/G/F<br />
C/G</div>
