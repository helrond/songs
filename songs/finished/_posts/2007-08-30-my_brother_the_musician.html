He believes in what he does and in what he's got to say<br />
He's got talent to burn; you should hear him play<br />
He is not distracted or bored with everything<br />
My brother the musician; how I wish I was him<br />
<br />
He has confidence and faith; he has plans that cannot fail<br />
My brother he believes that things are going to change<br />
His mistakes lie all ahead of him<br />
My brother the musician; how I wish I was him<br />
<br />
He knows how to relate and he makes friends easily<br />
No cripple of embarrassment; nothing if not free<br />
Not tied down by anything<br />
My brother the musician; how I wish I was him
