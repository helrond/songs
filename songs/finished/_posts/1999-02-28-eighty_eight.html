O Lord, I call for help by day<br />
I cry out in the night before you<br />
Let my prayer come before you<br />
Incline your ear to my cry

<div class="chorus">What do you want from me</div>

But I, I cry to you<br />
In the morning my prayer comes to you<br />
Why do you hide from me<br />
Leave me to drown in the terror of the night

<div class="chorus">What do you want from me</div>
<div class="chords">G/D/C/D</div>
