God how this city this city is rusting this<br />
City is turning to stone<br />
Doesn't it do wonders to your heart and your body<br />
When you grow the seeds that are sown<br />
<br />
Does violence breed in these paint chipped walls these<br />
Piss-soaked carpets these dark desolate halls<br />
There are some people who don't know this reality but<br />
If this isn't real, then who are we

<div class="chorus">God lives on Lafayette<br />
Do you<br />
Girl lives on Lafayette<br />
Do you</div>

Some will say that's the way it's go to be<br />
Forget to mention "it's fine as long as it's not me"<br />
Instant gratification, fast acting pain relief<br />
For everything except what really hurts, and you can see

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The man on top only sees what he's got to lose<br />
Down below, it's hard to know which drug to choose<br />
I'm somewhere in between looking out on this town<br />
Not sure if I'm going up or down
