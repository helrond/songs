I was born with a digital mind and analog skin<br />
All the places I can stand have gone to the wind<br />
But none of this, none of this, none of this<br />
Can bring me down<br />
<br />
I am a scientist; I draw my dreams<br />
From the deep and tainted wells of anthropology<br />
But none of this, none of this, none of this<br />
Can bring me down<br />
<br />
I was born with a face belonging to history<br />
And in a crowded room I am a refugee<br />
But none of this, none of this, none of this<br />
Can bring me down<br />
<br />
I left this city and a concrete soul<br />
Haunted by languages and staggering with hope<br />
And none of this, none of this, none of this<br />
Will bring me down</div>
