Love on the corner of 5th and Main<br />
Seen through a storefront window pane<br />
In the middle of the street when the light turns green<br />
Caught in the lines of history

<div class="chorus">I see you my hands are tied my innovation dry<br />
I see you another dream another life<br />
I see you where you could have been me<br />
I see you and my destiny</div>

Supermarket smile in the dairy aisle<br />
Name next to mine in the doctor's file<br />
Yearbook pictures of years gone by<br />
Turning your head, passed on the right

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Why was my mother born did she<br />
Find love across the sea<br />
Why have you been in my life my friends<br />
Where does fate begin and end 

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Am G Am Asus Em<br />
