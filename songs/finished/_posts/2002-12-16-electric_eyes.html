Love is a force that springs from the ashes of hate<br />
Hope is born like grass from the dirt<br />
Peace is what is built from the spoils of war<br />
Even divine beings have a human birth

<div class="chorus">Hey you<br />
All eyes on the messiah<br />
All hearts on the infinite truth<br />
Hey you <br />
All eyes toward Zion<br />
To the fountain of youth</div>

From the rubble of empires rises the star of a new dawn<br />
From the smell of death and the sound of steel comes everlasting song<br />
Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall if they are of this world<br />
No one is born with life eternal

<div class="chorus">CHORUS<br />
<br />
Just the other day there was love<br />
Don't throw it away</div>

Might be the greatest story ever told<br />
Might be a lie, might be truth, might be silver and gold<br />
Might be God, might be a man, might be something else<br />
Might be amazing grace

<div class="chorus">CHORUS<br />
<br />
Just the other day there was love<br />
Don't throw it away</div></div>
