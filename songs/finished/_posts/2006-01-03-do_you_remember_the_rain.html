Do you remember the rain<br />
The way that it came<br />
When it fell there was nowhere to go<br />
Do you remember the rain<br />
<br />
Do you remember the sun<br />
How it burned how it shone<br />
In the season too early for shade<br />
Do you remember the sun<br />
<br />
Do you remember the snow<br />
How it covered us both<br />
And the silence that spoke nothing false<br />
Do you remember the snow<br />

<div class="chorus">BRIDGE</div>

Do you remember the rain<br />
The way that it came<br />
And how it broke, how hard it fell<br />
Do you remember the rain
