Our apologies, good friends, for the fracture of order<br />
The burning of paper instead of children<br />
We could not, help us God, do any other<br />
Our hearts see the Land of the Burning Children

<div class="chorus">We're sorry that you had to turn<br />
But somewhere out there, children burn<br />
We're sorry that you had to see<br />
But it's the truth, and sets you free<br />
You say peace, peace, but there is no peace<br />
You say Lord, Lord, then you walk out the door<br />
You say love, love, on your hands I see blood<br />
And it's crying out to me</div>

We live in the One born to make trouble<br />
With him walk and with him we die<br />
On the side of the poor, forever we struggle<br />
And with that One, up there in the sky

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Thirty years later, the blood is still flowing<br />
The children are burning, the lies are growing<br />
Thirty years later, violence still turns<br />
And we, we know well, our hearts still burn

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

We come here today with God as our witness<br />
With love as a guide and truth as a shield<br />
To unmask, disarm, celebrate, announce<br />
The coming reign of the Calmer of Seas

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Verse: G/Bm/Am/D<br />
Chorus: G/D/Am/D</div>
