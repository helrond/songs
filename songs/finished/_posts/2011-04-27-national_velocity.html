You can run it back at half speed or play it double time<br />
Flip it upside down and backwards, sync it up and make it rhyme<br />
But no matter how you sell it or which way you make it spin<br />
You'll be going out the same way you came in<br />

<div class="chorus">There's no mistaking the direction<br />
The heading or the speed<br />
The weight of what is gone or what's to be<br />
It doesn't take a magician<br />
Or a prophet to see<br />
The national velocity</div>

You can dress it up in leather, top it off with a Stetson hat<br />
Get it all decked out uniform, epaulets and spats <br />
But whatever cut or color you decide to put it in<br />
It's still got that same ugly skin<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Well you can plaster it over so it looks like it's brand new <br />
Cover up the dirt with an attractive shade of blue<br />
But you've got to rebuild it, there's nothing else to do<br />
The whole thing is rotten through and through<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
