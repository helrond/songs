This is a prayer for community.<br />
This is a prayer for the cold,<br />
those without homes, those without coats.<br />
<br />
This is a prayer for the cold hearted,<br />
those who go through life with their heart and eyes closed.<br />
This is a prayer for those who care enough to make a difference.<br />
This is a prayer for those who commit their lives to a causes.<br />
<br />
This is a prayer for those who believe there is hope<br />
and for those who are hopeless, lonely, destitute.<br />
This is a prayer for those who have not yet found God,<br />
But are keeping their minds open.<br />
<br />
This is a prayer for all of us and all of them and all of everyone.<br />
Amen.
