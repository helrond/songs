I thought that on the day you married we'd close the Pentagon<br />
But you're in the chapel, bells are ringing, and we're still making war

<div class="chorus">Love turns war to peace<br />
Love hope and faith increase<br />
Love is the only thing you've ever known</div>

I thought that on the day you married everything would change<br />
But you're a husband and the rest of the world is still the same

<div class="chorus">Love turns the hands of time<br />
Love hurricane's eye<br />
Love is the only thing worth banking on</div>

I thought that on the day you married we'd reach the Promised Land<br />
But you've got the ring and we've got the same landscape of burning sand

<div class="chorus">Love turns the universe<br />
Love souls in joy immerse<br />
Love is the only thing left at the end</div>

I thought that on the day you married we would kiss the sky<br />
But we're still singing down at the levee and drinking whiskey and rye

<div class="chorus">Love turns two to one<br />
Love our redemption won<br />
Love is all in all for better or worse</div>
