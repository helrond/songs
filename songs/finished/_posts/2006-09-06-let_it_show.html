My father is an engineer I am his oldest son<br />
My mother gave to me every song I've sung

<div class="chorus">Let it show<br />
I love them more<br />
Let them know<br />
I love them all</div>

My sister is a modern girl she lives on rice and beans<br />
My brother is a carpenter with ironclad dreams

<div class="chorus">Let it show<br />
I love them more<br />
Let them know<br />
I love them all</div>

Though my friends are penniless they live around the world<br />
In Bishkek, Lima, Pouthisat and one in Kabul

<div class="chorus">Let it show<br />
I love them more<br />
Let them know<br />
I love them all</div>

To all my fellow travelers wherever they may be<br />
These thoughts go out, let them one day come back to me

<div class="chorus">Let it show<br />
I love them more<br />
Let them know<br />
I love them all</div>
