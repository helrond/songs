I have said you are all that I could ask for<br />
I have said that you are all I can see<br />
But that will not stop me expecting an angel<br />
And the dreams I have yet to dream

<div class="chorus">When I leave my legs will do the walking<br />
The downturn will be my economy's<br />
When I leave I will have finished talking<br />
And you will be watching me<br />
Walk away</div>

I have said you are all that I could ask for<br />
I have said that you are all I can see<br />
And though I cannot explain why I am not a liar<br />
I've seen the distance to eternity

<div class="chorus">When I leave my legs will do the walking<br />
The downturn will be my economy's<br />
When I leave I will have finished talking<br />
And you will be watching me
Walk away</div>
