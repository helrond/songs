<div class="notes">Title stolen from Chris Brown</div>
I was stretched out completely, I was at my breaking point<br>
I had given up on running or getting out of this joint<br>
Just looking for a way to profit from my loss<br>
I was in the desert, but I thought I was on the cross<br>
<br>
The heat was so intense it was impossible to think<br>
And it hurt to move and even more to drink<br>
Waiting for an angel to stand by my side<br>
I was in the desert, but I thought I was in the fire<br>
<br>
The darkness was so thick you could cut it with a knife<br>
And I cursed my luck and the story of my life<br>
I was hoping that righteousness would go my bail<br>
I was in the desert, but I thought I was in the whale<br>
<br>
The wind whipped past my ears and salt was in my nose<br>
I drifted further from the shore no matter how hard I rowed<br>
Wishing I could walk on water, know how full my nets might be<br>
I was in the desert, but I thought I was on the sea<br>
