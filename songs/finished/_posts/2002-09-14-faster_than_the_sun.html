Climbing up out of the valley in the early morning light<br />
Our conscience on our backs a new world fades into sight<br />
You know that government's a liar worse than anyone<br />
Moving faster than the sun<br />
<br />
Is there a difference if he is distant if God is watching us<br />
Have you met the ghosts of history or the devils of progress<br />
Don't you know what's in the contract to be a mortal one<br />
Moving faster than the sun<br />
<br />
Do you know a man whose body is covered in scars<br />
Do you know saints and martyrs and knights in bright armor<br />
Don't you know how Daedalus lost his only son <br />
Moving faster than the sun<br />
<br />
I know you're not my savior you can't hide those bloody hands<br />
I know you're not the one to be led to slaughter like the lambs<br />
I know that anybody could die for what you've done<br />
Moving faster than the sun<br />
<br />
Are you wide awake and breathing or have you fallen fast asleep<br />
And is the voice of reason the thought you'd choose to keep<br />
Is this the beginning of the end of innocence or an end to everyone<br />
Moving faster than the sun
