Wake up in the morning and I find you're still asleep<br />
Later in the evening you will find your life's a dream<br />
Whose eyes are those watching you, who ties you down<br />
Who calls you every evening to make sure that you're around<br />
<br />
What is it you're looking for what is it you need<br />
What is it you want from me say it on your knees

<div class="chorus">Save me<br />
You can't save yourself</div>

Toilet stalls and paper walls, I saw a funny thing today<br />
A man looking down the mouth of a gun to see what it would say<br />
All these books and magazines will bury you alive<br />
You're asking, begging, praying to the New York Times

<div class="chorus">Save me<br />
You can't save yourself</div>

Montezuma was a good king, FDR better yet<br />
Lenin would have done all right if he hadn't been so set<br />
History repeats itself; it's never quite the same<br />
It's a good excuse to cut your mind loose, if you can see what I'm saying

<div class="chorus">Save me<br />
You can't save yourself</div>

I know Dylan was really Zimmerman before he got big<br />
I've been to where the Clash played their first gig<br />
I've got a mind full of numbers that don't make no sense<br />
I've got plenty of ideas of no consequence

<div class="chorus">Save me<br />
You can't save yourself</div>
<div class="chords">G / Cadd9</div>
