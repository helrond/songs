The bells are ringing down in the valley ringing for my wife<br />

Crops are ruined, ain't no harvest, there was a terrible drought<br />

He drinks whiskey every evening, sleeps through the day<br />

The Senator came to our town, drove up and down, gave a great speech<br />

Billy joined the army, had a baby, went off to die in the war<br />
We all say he can sin no more
