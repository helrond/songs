Got me a gun and a fake tattoo<br />
A flight suit and a Bible too<br />
Got me a gun and a fake tattoo<br />
I'm a Soldier of the Lord<br />
<br />
I shoot first and I shoot to kill<br />
I defend God's Holy Will<br />
I shoot first and I shoot to kill<br />
I'm a Soldier of the Lord<br />
<br />
Got me a mandate to use force<br />
Got me one that's bigger than yours<br />
Got me a mandate to use force<br />
I'm a Soldier of the Lord<br />
<br />
I come in hard I come in strong<br />
I come in low out of the rising sun<br />
I come in hard I come in strong<br />
I'm a Soldier of the Lord<br />
<br />
Got me an army got me a war<br />
Got me political capital<br />
Got me an army got me a war<br />
I'm a Soldier of the Lord
