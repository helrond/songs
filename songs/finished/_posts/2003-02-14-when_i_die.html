title: When I Die

When I die I want it to be like this facing the sun<br />
I was not born to fade away turn tail and run<br />
Though my life is over I will have just begun<br />
When I die I want it to be like this facing the dawn<br />
<br />
When I die I want it to be like this braving the rain<br />
Forged shackles cannot hold me down nor ball and chain<br />
What I have done to deserve this I dare not explain<br />
When I die I want it to be like this not fearing pain<br />
<br />
When I die I want it to be like this chasing the storm<br />
I would not burn this world to ash if it could be transformed<br />
Thought I have reaped the whirlwind's wrath clench not my palm <br />
When I die I want it to be like this embracing calm<br />
<br />
Take me and wash me in this flood of justice rolling down<br />
Let it rock me let it roll me let it purify my soul<br />
The song of great awakening lifted by wind and fire<br />
Borne on the wings of a homeward flow<br />
And the laughter, the laughter of a child
