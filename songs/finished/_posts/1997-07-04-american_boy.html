He was a good kid, loved America,<br />
Strawberry Pop-tarts, apple pie.<br />
Baseball on summer afternoons,<br />
Good American boy.<br />
<br />
He was a good soldier, saved another's life,<br />
Played by the rules, never said no.<br />
Never mind what he did, he obeyed orders<br />
Good American boy.<br />

<div class="chorus">American boy comes home to America,<br />
War does something to everyone.<br />
American boy loves his America,<br />
Oh little boy, where have you gone?</div>

April 15, nineteen hundred and ninety five<br />
A blast breaks the Oklahoma sky<br />
America watches in horror and amazement<br />
Somebody has to die.

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

He's a monster, cold, unhuman, dead<br />
Of another species, what's in his head<br />
Stony-eyed, emotionless, killer of children's joys<br />
Good American boy

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Fry him, fry him, fry him, fry him, he's the one<br />
Forget John Doe, government implication<br />
Ax man, governmental toy<br />
Good American boy

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Chorus: G/D/Am/C/D</div>
