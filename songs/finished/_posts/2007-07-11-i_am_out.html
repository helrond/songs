I am out to write a song for everybody<br />
For all who've been and all those yet to come<br />
For everyone who's given up completely<br />
I am out to sing a song for everyone<br />
<br />
I am out to write a song for everybody<br />
Who's seen their share of hard times and dreams<br />
The rich, the poor, the losers and the winners<br />
And everybody else in between

<div class="chorus">A song for every person, in every single land<br />
For all of those personalities<br />
For every single city, and every single town<br />
It's a song just for me</div>

I am out to write a song for every season<br />
I am out to write a song for every day<br />
For the ghettos, the suburbs and the country<br />
For the places and names that never change<br />
<br />
I am out to write a song for every country<br />
For every planet, every single sun<br />
And it will be like I believe, like I belong<br />
I am out to write this universe a song

<div class="chorus">A song for every person, in every single land<br />
For all of those personalities<br />
For every single city, and every single town<br />
It's a song just for me</div>
