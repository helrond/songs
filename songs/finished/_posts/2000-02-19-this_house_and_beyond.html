Dreaming<br />
I think I am dreaming again<br />
I see a house, paint chipped and multicolored<br />
That we are fond of rebuilding,<br />
but reluctant to rebuild<br />
<br />
The foundation is cracked, the walls are eroding,<br />
It will fall soon<br />
A blue collared crew had gathered<br />
wrecking ball ready, they will knock it down<br />
and prepare to erect a new<br />
<br />
I recognize God as one of the workers<br />
He had no white beard and no wrath<br />
He is taut muscle, and laugh<br />
He brings a bagged lunch<br />
And smokes a pack and a half each day<br />
<br />
He smokes while he unloads the trucks <br />
and hands the fresh lumber to us<br />
<br />
We are ready to build this new house,<br />
a simple house, something pure and patriotic<br />
something we can step inside and call our own<br />
and strong house built on the backs of believers<br />
<br />
and out across the lawn I see God,<br />
leaning up against a tree and smiling<br />
because we have had the answers all along,<br />
and so we build from dusk till dawn<br />
<br />
One by one, this house<br />
and then beyond<br />
<br />
