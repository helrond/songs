No I don't sleep<br />
No I am not dead<br />
No I will never leave you<br />
I'll be with you instead<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid<br />
I am with you, just like I said<br />
Don't cry and mourn<br />
I guide you, don't be forlorn</div>

I'm in the breeze that ripples the grass<br />
I'm in the leaves as they float past<br />
I'm in the autumn's russet and brown<br />
I am with you and I'll never let you down

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I'm in the small stream's song<br />
As it frolics along<br />
In the wind that ruffles your hair<br />
I am with you, I will always be there

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/C/G/C<br />
Em/C/D<br />
G/C/G/C<br />
Em/D/G<br />
<br />
Em/Am/Bm<br />
Em/Am/D<br />
Em/Am/Bm<br />
