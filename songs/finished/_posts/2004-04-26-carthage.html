The fields near the shore have been turned by the harrow the women are baking bread for tomorrow<br />
Ashes of corpses and ashes of houses and blood on the land<br />
Columns of smoke rise as emblems of despair the loudspeaker sputters out a final call to prayer<br />
Broken horizons and hobbling horses and blood on the sand

<div class="chorus">Who am I to call myself son of the stars<br />
Who am I to deny the claims of my heart<br />
Who am I to call Carthage my own</div>

The house holds its ruin within its own walls the foundation stones are the seeds of downfall<br />
Salt in the wounds salt in the furrows the bend of the knees<br />
The sons burning Carthage are sons born of Priam and daughters of Cain are the sisters of Zion<br />
Elephants coming down out of the mountains and fear on the breeze

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Here in this city where the talk shows are tragic where staying alive feels like studying magic<br />
Where I am still looking for Truth in the circus and lies in the Times<br />
Wander these streets â€˜til the desert has made me numb ride on these rails like a disciple sick for home<br />
Write down the memories of your wooden soldiers and write down your crimes

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

If you were Queen Dido and I was Aeneas how could I how would I have left this heavenly bliss<br />
Does that make me the slave of passion or king of my fate<br />
If I was destined for the founding of empire how could I conquer the walls of desire<br />
Would I be captive to gods in the heavens or gods of my mind

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Em/G/C/Am<br />
Em/G/C/D<br />
<br />
Em/D/G/D</div>
