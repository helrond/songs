Did you catch me standing in the rain<br />
Did you catch me a little less than sane<br />
Did you catch me with my heart up my sleeve<br />
Did you catch me with holes in my knees<br />
<br />
Did you catch me with my head in the clouds<br />
Did you catch me dreaming too out loud<br />
Did you catch me not knowing enough<br />
Does it give you the feeling you're such…

<div class="chorus">Go on and tell me I'm wrong<br />
You're fighting a war that can't be won</div>

Do you have more of the facts<br />
Do you have what it takes to act<br />
Do you have the answer that's right<br />
Is it the one made so by might

<div class="chorus">Go on and sing your fighting song<br />
This is just another war that can't be won</div>

I caught you, "Live Free or Die"<br />
I caught you again, Semper Fi<br />
I caught you towing your bit of the line<br />
I caught you staking out your piece of the pie

<div class="chorus">Listen up or you won't last long<br />
If you're fighting a war, you won't be one<br />
So go on and tell me what is on<br />
What you haven't lost is what you've won</div>
