You talk about compromise<br />
Say it's not free<br />
You talk about acceptable prices<br />
Look at me<br />
<br />
You talk about dictators<br />
How to foil their plans<br />
You talk about genocide<br />
Look at your hands

<div class="chorus">Meet me halfway to the land<br />
Where two rivers run through poisoned sand<br />
Meet me before time runs out the door<br />
And we are no more<br />
<br />
They look to our eyes for hope<br />
They look to our eyes<br />
They look to our eyes for hope<br />
We have none</div>

You talk about our duty<br />
Protect the weak<br />
You talk about collateral damage<br />
Let them speak

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Am/G<br />
