Mister Secretary <br />
I know you don't know my name<br />
I know that you are truly grateful<br />
That you are not the only one to blame<br />
<br />
Mister Secretary<br />
I have just one demand<br />
If I die in this godforsaken place <br />
Sign the letter by hand

<div class="chorus">You can send me off to fight your dirty jihad<br />
You can hang me out to dry<br />
You can sign me up let them cut me to pieces<br />
Just put your John Hancock on the line</div>

Mister Secretary<br />
I know you don't read the news<br />
I know we fight with the army we have<br />
Not the army we'd choose

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Mister Secretary<br />
I know there's solid evidence<br />
I know that all the armor in the world<br />
Is not a sufficient defense

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/D/C/C<br />
<br />
C/G/D/G</div>
