You passed it on like some disease<br />
What it's become you can't believe<br />
How it looks and what was said<br />
The thoughts to which that led

<div class="chorus">You let it, you let it out<br />
Look where it's gone<br />
You let it, you let it out<br />
Look what it's done</div>

You wear it out all over town<br />
A secret that's been passed around<br />
Until it's worn through every seam<br />
Until it's obvious and mean<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You put it out on every line<br />
You let it ring and let it ride<br />
Over the wires to your defense<br />
In search of blood and consequence

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/Am/G<br />
F/G<br />
C/Am/G<br />
F/G<br />
<br />
Am/C/G</div>
