I don't know if I should laugh or scream in our time, in our time<br />
Hold my position or hide my trail in the stream in our time, in our time<br />
To howl at the moon or bury my head in the sand in our time, in our time<br />
If it's a joke or a nightmare, hypnosis or a spell, these times are slipping through my hands<br />
<br />
Hidden screaming horses and cowering men in our time, in our time<br />
I've seen you out there on the highway trading flesh and sin in our time, in our time<br />
I have prayed to God Almighty that justice would be done in our time, in our time<br />
Blocked up my ears and eyes, mouth, mind and nose, these times are almost gone<br />
<br />
There are tears in my eyes from the smoke blown in my face in our time, in our time<br />
My conscience hangs in tatters my allegiance in disgrace in our time, in our time<br />
The battle cries ring hollow though I have the will to fight in our time, in our time<br />
I've seen a wheel in a wheel, I've seen the Valley of Dry Bones but these are times I can't tell wrong from right
