I wanted to tell you that this was forever and ever amen<br />
But nothing's forever not even diamonds can last till the end<br />
Am I a companion<br />
Or have I been just a friend<br />
I wanted to tell you that this was forever but we are just mortal men<br />
<br />
I wanted to tell you that I was not terrified by any of this<br />
Although I knew even then it would not matter you were scared stiff<br />
Have I stayed the pathway<br />
Or have I gone adrift<br />
I wanted to tell you that I was not terrified but I was nervous<br />
<br />
I wanted to tell you that we could do miracles, turn water to wine<br />
And now I see in the dullness of everyday wisdom divine<br />
Have I seen the kingdom<br />
Or have my eyes been blind<br />
I wanted to tell you that we could do miracles God was passing by<br />
<br />
I want you to tell me that you are my savior and this will work out<br />
But you can't reply cause you're mired in inertia with no way out<br />
Have I been dependent<br />
Or have I not been in doubt<br />
I wanted to tell you that you are my savior but you aren't even devout<br />
<br />
I want you to tell me that there is no consequence to following stars<br />
But of the sacrifice you know as well as I we have our scars<br />
Have I been certain<br />
Or have I been starry-eyed<br />
I want you to tell me that there is no consequence to live by your heart<br />
<br />
I wanted to tell you that changes may come and go some things are not new<br />
But now I know that though it may set you free truth kills you too<br />
Have I surrendered<br />
Or have I started anew<br />
I wanted to tell you that changes may come and go but I'm going too
