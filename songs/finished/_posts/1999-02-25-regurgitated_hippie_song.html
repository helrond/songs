In a maze of whirling color<br />
I caught a glimpse of a face I used to know<br />
It smiled at me<br />
And I turned because I wanted it to go away<br />
I saw the life<br />
Of a boy searching for peace and love<br />
He left his home<br />
His mother but his home did not leave him<br />

<div class="chorus">Throw out peaceloveharmony<br />
And eveyone's equality<br />
Shinyhappypeaceful feeling<br />
All the rainbow colors reeling<br />
Push through the haze of rights and hippyites<br />
The potsmokingvegan needs a light<br />
Stagger down the stairs to the wall<br />
Where you see it scrawled<br />
<br />
I just want to be happy<br />
I just want to be free<br />
I just want to be happy<br />
I just want to be me</div>

He traveled far<br />
He traveled further than the farthest star<br />
He ever dreamed of<br />
He ever saw out the back window of his car<br />
But when it came <br />
Down to what he knew and what he felt<br />
He couldn't help<br />
But stop to wonder if all this was what he meant
