I climbed to the top of St. Peter's on a dark and crowded stair<br />
And I stood and watched the city gasping for air<br />
I stumbled down a mineshaft in a medieval town<br />
Holding to my lantern like a sailor going down

<div class="chorus">Now I'm really seeing things<br />
Now I'm really seeing things</div>

Crossing California in the heart of Chinatown<br />
Saw written on a tower “son, observe the time”<br />
And I passed by the Sir Francis and Huey Newton's home<br />
On streets where ghosts of sailors and Ferlinghetti roam

<div class="chorus">Now I'm really seeing things<br />
Now I'm really seeing things</div>

And saw an Artic Tern flying pole to pole<br />
Songs and cats developesd with some patience and care<br />
At every border crossing I had nothing to declare

<div class="chorus">Now I'm really seeing things<br />
Now I'm really seeing things</div>
