<div class="notes">"Blood will have blood" - Shakespeare, Macbeth</div>
It's a beautiful day in December and the war is coming home<br />
Across the fields where shepherds sleep tanks of the armies roam<br />
Sees the blood in the toilet bowl thinks of her late addition<br />
The way her body is bound to the moon in constant capitulation<br />

<div class="chorus">You tell me<br />
Is it your heart or down below<br />
For your country or for your soul<br />
That you bleed</div>

The agents of fear and disorder crawl the salty brine<br />
Drink from the wells of beauty and health drink to the prophetic sign<br />
Marines have landed on the shores of the bay cut off escape over land<br />
They've already taken the radio station armed to the teeth to a man<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS<br />
<br />
I heard you say<br />
All that rises must submerge<br />
I heard you say <br />
Red sky at morn does sailors warn<br />
I heard you say<br />
Whatever goes around<br />
Must come<br />
Must come around</div>

This time when they lock you up for your trust in the holy grail<br />
No walls will fall or chains come loose no angel go your bail<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Em/G/D/Em <br />
<br />
C/D/G<br />
C/D/G/Em<br />
C/D/G/Em<br />
C/D/<br />
<br />
C/G</div>
