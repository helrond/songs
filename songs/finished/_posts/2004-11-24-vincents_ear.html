They say that a few years before he did himself in<br />
Vincent had a very nasty row with Gauguin<br />
He went home and took a razor to his left ear<br />
Wrapped it up and gave it as a present to his dear<br />
<br />
To his surprise she did not like his gift much at all<br />
She called the cops and had him packed off to L'Hospital<br />
The ear was kept as evidence in an alcohol-filled jar<br />
It disappeared in the hole of history's black star

<div class="chorus">But what happened to Vincent's ear <br />
Was it buried six feet under, was it sold for an ice-cold beer<br />
Did some junior detective steal it out of spite<br />
Or did it end up drifting through the starry, starry night</div>

They say Vincent was crazy and it might have been the truth<br />
His style was unconventional his manner was uncouth<br />
Failure was his standard and loss his destiny<br />
He was not a darling of the petty bourgeoisie<br />
<br />
He loved the sun and sunflowers he loved his cousin<br />
He painted portraits of the entire family Roulin<br />
In the yellow cafes at night he'd daub away the time<br />
But everybody thought him mad, his ear not worth a dime

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

He lived in an asylum, he wrote letters to Theo<br />
And then one day he shot himself, it's adios Van Gogh<br />
If Vincent were still alive and kicking today<br />
His ear would be up for auction on eBay
