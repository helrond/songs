<div class="chorus">Float on the water,<br />
Blown by the wind<br />
In every direction<br />
And nothing within<br />
Form without function<br /> 
Art with no core<br />
Shells</div>

Put up a facade, don't let them reach you<br />
Break down the bridge, you're safer with no clue<br />
But when all the connections are gone<br />
Don't look back 'cause your life will be gone<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Keep it sweet, plenty of kisses<br />
You know how, will they miss you<br />
If I die in my sleep tonight<br />
What will they say about my life<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

This static growth, stunted and rotting<br />
You're dead inside and stop existing<br />
Yeah you crumble, inward you fall<br />
Can't look up, you were so tall

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/D/Em/D<br />
G/D/C/D<br />
<br />
G/D/Em/D<br />
G/D/C/D<br />
G/D/C/G<br />
G/D/C/D</div>
