I will wait patiently, like a hawk<br />
I will pay no mind to wind and rain or the heat of the sun<br />
And when everything has failed and all our promises are gone<br />
I will wait patiently, like a hawk<br />
<br />
I will watch carefully, like a hawk<br />
I will see everything that moves in the daytime or the night<br />
Standing guard over my failings and the inventions of my mind<br />
I will watch carefully, like a hawk<br />
<br />
I will stay faithfully, like a hawk<br />
Without fear of what will be, of the inevitable slope<br />
I will not be swayed by hunger or betrayed by hope<br />
I will stay faithfully, like a hawk<br />
