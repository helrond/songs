I am an immigrant flying high above the earth <br />
Given to second chances and second birth<br />
Ten thousand feet above water somewhere under heaven<br />
And I've lost the trail trying to get home again<br />
<br />
I have visions that are flying through my head <br />
Of chances come and gone and left for dead<br />
Stuck between continents stuck between worlds<br />
Stuck between cultures stuck in this whirl<br />
<br />
I have given up thoughts of saving grace <br />
And fire that purifies from a higher place<br />
I'm stuck with demons that I wish weren't mine<br />
Stuck with this journey stuck with time<br />
<br />
I am an immigrant flying high above the earth <br />
Given to second chances and second birth<br />
Five hundred miles out of Newark many more to come<br />
The place I am going is not my home
