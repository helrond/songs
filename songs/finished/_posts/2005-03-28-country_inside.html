It's raining in New York City and the trees are digging in<br />
Their roots against the concrete; something's got to give<br />
Standing in the doorway the sky opens wide<br />
Outside is the city but I got country inside

<div class="chorus">Writing country songs is easy; you don't need a cheating heart<br />
A gal who's gone and left you, a dog that's up and died<br />
A truck that won't turn over, a horse running wild<br />
Writing country songs is easy when you've got country inside</div>

There's a dog outside the deli staring at the door<br />
And I wonder who that someone is that he is waiting for<br />
While I tended to my conscience this city stole my eyes<br />
But everybody knows me in my country inside

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The pigeons have abandoned the Armory roof<br />
I wish I could go somewhere; the place that they've gone to<br />
I'm wishing for horizons, endless lines of sight<br />
I'm wishing I had more than the country inside

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
