When I get up to that Promised Land<br />
When I get up to that Promised Land<br />
When I get up to that Promised Land<br />
Won't have to tell nobody where I stand<br />
When I get up to that Promised Land<br />
<br />
...won't have to lend no helping hand<br />
<br />
...I'll be playing guitar in a honky-tonk band<br />
<br />
...I'll be drinking whisky, shooting cans<br />
<br />
...it'll be the end of my best laid plans<br />
<br />
...won't have to dodge the police man<br />
<br />
...every deal will be a winning hand
