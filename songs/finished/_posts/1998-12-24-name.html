Felt the call of conscience trace the palm of my hand<br />
Followed it across the waves and swam into sand<br />
Found myself alone in blackness speaking to the stars<br />
Ancient history of light poured down between the bars<br />
<br />
Are you the first the last are you a now or have been<br />
Where are you going what have you seen<br />
I scream at you but you can't hear a thing<br />
Just listen to the night sun listen to the wind

<div class="chorus">Do you know my name<br />
Do you know my name<br />
Do you know my name<br />
Do you know my name...<br />
<br />
Time to rise and I heard you fall<br />
One for one and all for all<br />
Do you hear me now<br />
Come on...<br />
Hear me...<br />
<br />
Do you know my name<br />
Do you know my name<br />
Do you know my name<br />
Do you know my name...</div>

Names in a faceless world we're all<br />
Trying to live under the pall<br />
Of life without a future here<br />
There's all this noise no one can hear

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Am/Em<br />
<br />
C/G/Am/G<br />
