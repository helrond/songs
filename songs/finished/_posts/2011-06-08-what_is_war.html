What is war when it's over<br />
What will grow on these fields<br />
Where does all the water run to<br />
When it reaches the sea<br />
<br />
What is rain when it's fallen<br />
What's the law without a gun<br />
What is hate and what is mercy<br />
When you don't know where they're from<br />
<br />
What's a sound with no echo<br />
What is carries on the breeze<br />
What's become of your confessions<br />
What will you make of your disease<br />
<br />
What is war when it's over<br />
What will grow on these fields<br />
What's a grave grown over<br />
What will become of history
