What is war when it's over
What will grow on these fields
Where does all the water run to
When it reaches the sea

What is rain when it's fallen
What's the law without a gun
What is hate and what is mercy
When you don't know where they're from

What's a sound with no echo
What is carries on the breeze
What's become of your confessions
What will you make of your disease

What is war when it's over
What will grow on these fields
What's a grave grown over
What will become of history
