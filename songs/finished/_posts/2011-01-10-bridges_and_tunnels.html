Take the road through the heart of the mountain<br />
Or the bend in the river tonight<br />
The blood in your veins, the steam in your trains<br />
All the miles they have brought into sight<br />
<br />
And I stood and I saw there a kingdom<br />
Built of highways, channels and wires<br />
All round my head there are waves being read<br />
By the road there are shrines

<div class="chorus">And a bridge takes you over<br />
Tunnels cut right on through<br />
Knowing your need for motion and speed<br />
The will finds ways to you</div>

You will build the things that are needed<br />
To cross over distance or time<br />
What you're getting or giving or who you've been missing<br />
Determines the speed and the line

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
