I still remember the day they took her innocence<br />
I still remember the pain of endurance<br />
The day was dark, night darker yet<br />
Stars watching above us never set<br />
<br />
We were here waiting for a savior<br />
Instead of him you sent a killer<br />
I can remember I'm still dreaming of <br />
He said forgive me it was love

<div class="chorus">Night is screaming and the screams become the stars<br />
That shine down upon our bloodied scars<br />
Night is screaming through a darkened glass<br />
Holding up back against our past</div>

There are no Christians in this Christian land<br />
There are no wounds on these Christian hands<br />
There is no white in these painted lies<br />
There are no ears to hear their cries<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

There is always one to escape<br />
There is always one to call it a miracle<br />
There is always one to scream out silently<br />
There is always one to escape

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">E/G#m/A/B</div>
