My love's at the water's edge<br />
Pulling up lustrife and sedge<br />
She's bringing me flowers to wear<br />
My love's at the water's edge<br />
<br />
My love is a runaway train<br />
Walking barefoot in the rain<br />
Down in the valley she's howling my name<br />
My love is a runaway train<br />
<br />
My love is a holy nation<br />
A sign of contradiction<br />
Like a black crow rests on a juniper tree<br />
My love is a holy nation

<div class="chorus">Now I stand before your mystery<br />
Now I stand before your grace<br />
Now I stand before your radiance<br />
Now I stand before your face</div>

My love hears an outdated tune<br />
She dances with the moon<br />
She comes to me, she says taste and see<br />
My love hears an outdated tune<br />
<br />
My love's at the water's edge<br />
Pulling up lustrife and sedge<br />
She's bringing me flowers to wear<br />
My love's at the water's edge

<div class="chorus">And if I fall before your mystery<br />
I will not fall beyond your grace<br />
And if I fall beyond your radiance<br />
I will not fall before your face</div>
