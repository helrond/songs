I paid thirty dollars to get in<br />
To Birkenstock heaven<br />
She said, "If you guys can sing,<br />
It's a hell of a way to make a living."<br />
<br />
And outside the rain poured down<br />
On the backs of the stoned flower children<br />
And inside it's shoulder to shoulder<br />
"Hey, you see that, I think I know her."

<div class="chorus">It's the same as it was back in '69<br />
We still think we're not part of these times<br />
From the mainstream we've bought our dissent<br />
Because we never quite understood what we meant<br />
<br />
You can wear your heart on your sleeve, your hat, your chest<br />
You can grow your hair long so you look like the rest<br />
You can learn the guitar and write your own bad songs<br />
You could be the next Dylan if you could just get it wrong</div>

Down the road they're tearing down towers<br />
Building who knows what, a degenerational fate<br />
This is our generation's prowess<br />
To find new and creative ways to hate

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
