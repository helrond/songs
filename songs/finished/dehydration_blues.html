<div class="lyrics">Hold on Birmingham<br />
There's a storm coming through<br />
It will leave you with dust in your hand<br />
Working on your dehydration blues<br />
Working on your dehydration blues<br />
<br />
Hole up San Antone<br />
With your cards and your booze<br />
Drink away what you cannot lose<br />
Try to lose your dehydration blues<br />
Try to lose your dehydration blues<br />
<br />
Stay strong Buffalo<br />
I've got shelter for you<br />
I've got pills to get me through<br />
Get me through these dehydration blues<br />
Get me through these dehydration blues<br />
<br />
Hold on while you can<br />
There's a flood coming soon<br />
It will run through your worn out shoes<br />
Wash away your dehydration blues<br />
Wash away your dehydration blues</div>
