<div class="lyrics">I'm locked in a jungle of concrete and steel.<br />
I see only the sky slashed apart by the bars.<br />
Two bees buzz around my head and remind<br />
Me of meadows and grasses and flowers

<div class="chorus">Walk bare-foot in the grass and think of me<br />
Feel the breeze in your hair<br />
Gaze at the deep blue sky and think of me<br />
I will be there</div>

God is so great and God is so good<br />
He made all things with His mighty hand<br />
He made grasses he made flowers<br />
And he made you too
