<div class="lyrics">For everyone who's trusted every word<br />
For those who don't believe a thing they've heard<br />
For everyone who stayed at home and all those who kept moving on<br />
I sat down and wrote them this song

<div class="chorus">And I will thank you kindly<br />
Thank you kindly<br />
Thank you kindly my friends</div>

For everyone who values what they owe<br />
For those who have got no soul<br />
For everyone who'd die for it and those who just don't give a shit<br />
Without you I am nothing at all<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

For everyone who left me alone<br />
And those who took me as one of their own<br />
Who opened wide their hearts and homes, a place to stay where I roamed<br />
Without you I am wondering still<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

For everyone who is all I want to be<br />
For those who are living out my fears<br />
Those who hit the harmonies and those who can't find the key<br />
I could not sing without you<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

For everyone sure of where they're going<br />
For those who have forgotten all they know<br />
For those too serious to smile and those who laugh so hard they cry<br />
You have taught me everything I know

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
