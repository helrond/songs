<div class="lyrics">Hello I'm crazy how are you<br />
Got locked in and I can't leave the zoo<br />
Hello my mind is out of sight<br />
Another ball is dropped and broken into night

<div class="chorus">If this really is<br />
The land of the free<br />
Why are you tied to<br />
Your SUV</div>

Am I the only one who's got<br />
A warning on my cup contents are hot<br />
Am I the only one who missed<br />
The warnings on our instruments of death

<div class="chorus">If this really is<br />
The home of the brave<br />
Why the hell<br />
Are we so afraid</div>

We are so set on nuclear domination<br />
We have no idea that we have a case of mental constipation<br />
I want to know if all the shit we've got<br />
Is really worth defending

<div class="chorus">Quiet desperation<br />
Shopping cart hell<br />
Quiet desecration<br />
By a five star general</div>

The scales of justice are permanently fixed<br />
To keep the poor brown people permanently jinxed<br />
Line up step right, don't cross the line<br />
Do as you're told and you'll do just fine

<div class="chorus">Who let the tiger<br />
Out of the zoo<br />
Could it be so<br />
Maybe you're crazy too</div></div>
