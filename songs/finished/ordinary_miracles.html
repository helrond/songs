<div class="lyrics">My eyes have seen the glory of ages to come and of years that have passed<br />
I have seen hours swell and wither, empires turn into dust<br />
Under the sun and over the moon and before the reason why<br />
I have seen hills razed and valleys exalted I've seen Satan fall from the sky<br />
<br />
My ears have heard the blessings of freedom and its terrible price<br />
I have heard harsh and dreadful sounds of the love between fire and ice<br />
Facing the dream behind conviction after the end of the world<br />
I have heard things to be long forgotten and the banner of laughter unfurled<br />
<br />
My mouth has spoken words of deception, words of true insight<br />
I have sung love and I have screamed hate and I have cried out to the light<br />
From the mouth of God in the heavens comes the words of a child<br />
I have spoken of visions at hand I've been baptized by desire</div>
