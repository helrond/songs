<div class="lyrics">I cannot know the weight of this world<br />
I've got nothing to tell you but all the wrong words<br />
I cannot know the weight, the weight of this world<br />
I am helpless, just like you<br />
<br />
I cannot know the weight of these years<br />
I cannot bind the accuser, discredit these fears<br />
And under the weight, the weight of these years<br />
I am broken, just like you<br />
<br />
I cannot know the weight of this pull<br />
The places you're pushed all beyond your control<br />
In gravity's power, oblivion's hold<br />
I am lonely, just like you<br />
<br />
I cannot know the weight of this world<br />
The best I can do are these simple words<br />
That hanging there that afternoon<br />
He was helpless, just like you</div>
