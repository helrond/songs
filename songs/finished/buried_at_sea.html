Is there anyone here who knows what is wrong with me<br />
Why I don't know what to think, why I'm afraid to speak<br />
And does anyone know what it is I'm doing here<br />
Where nobody else seems to feel the way I feel

<div class="chorus">And I walked all the way here just to discover why<br />
This loneliness I'm feeling has got to be a lie<br />
All the way across town, all the way to the end<br />
All the distance between justice and revenge</div>

Does everyone here know something that I don't<br />
Do they already know  if I will or I won't<br />
And does anyone else feel as nervous as I do<br />
Am I missing out on the obvious truth

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Is there anyone here who knows what is wrong with me<br />
Am I destined like a sailor to be buried at sea<br />
And can anyone tell me about the shape I'm in<br />
And if everything's changed why I can't feel a thing
