<div class="lyrics">Say what you will and say what you want my friend<br />
Say what you will and say what you want again<br />
Because I've been watching you for hours with your amphetamines and flowers<br />
Say what you want my ordinary friend<br />
<br />
Turn the radio on and tune it in<br />
Turn that radio on, confess your sin<br />
Tell the only ones who know, Doctor Brinkley, Tokyo Rose<br />
Turn that radio up and listen in

<div class="chorus">It's the way it used to be<br />
The same things coming down over the sea<br />
And I know he waits for me<br />
Dressed in rhinestones and pushing speed</div>

Sun coming up across the Great Divide<br />
Shadows running down the other side<br />
And you waited like a gong holding ashes on your tongue<br />
As the sun comes up across the Great Divide
