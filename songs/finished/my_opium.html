<div class="lyrics">I want you to soar<br />
Like a gull into the wind<br />
But freedom dictates it own terms<br />
And humans don't have wings

<div class="chorus">There are times to sink into a haze of perfect distraction<br />
Times to dwell in clarity and times to live in sin<br />
There are times to remember and times to regret<br />
Times I want my opium</div>

I want you to rise up<br />
Like Lazarus from your tomb<br />
But there is no one to call you forth<br />
No one to touch your wounds

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I want you to burn<br />
Like Rome while Nero plays<br />
But I know too well a fire needs a spark<br />
A moment to sets hearts ablaze

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
