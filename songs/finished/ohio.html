<div class="lyrics">Baby my heart is yours forever<br />
Baby my light is always on<br />
You know I've got what you've been wanting<br />
You know my love for you is strong<br />
<br />
Baby you've got to give me something<br />
Baby you've got to show a sign<br />
I've just got to have an answer<br />
My love will not be denied<br />

<div class="chorus">Oh Ohio<br />
I'm at your window I am calling your name<br />
Oh Ohio<br />
Don't run from me don't leave me this way</div>

Baby I know there may be others<br />
I know you're red, you could be blue<br />
Baby if I can't be your only<br />
Just more than half of you will do
