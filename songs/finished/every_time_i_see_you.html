<div class="lyrics">Tell me why every time I see you<br />
Tell me why every time I see you<br />
Why it rains every time I see you<br />
<br />
Tell me why every time I see you<br />
Tell me why every time I see you<br />
Why you smile every time I see you

<div class="chorus">Thunder and lighting, hurricanes<br />
A runaway freight train<br />
Don't knock me out or loosen my knees<br />
I'm not scared of spiders or snakes<br />
Afraid of the dark or that thing in the lake<br />
My tongue's tied up, I can't even speak<br />
Every time I see you</div>

Tell me why every time I see you<br />
Tell me why every time I see you<br />
I'm a fool every time I see you

<div class="chorus">Vampires and bogeymen<br />
All the king's horses, all the king's men<br />
Don't shake me up don't rattle my teeth<br />
I'm not scared of looking over the edge<br />
Or the monster curled up under my bed<br />
My tongue's tied up, I can't even speak<br />
Every time I see you</div></div>
