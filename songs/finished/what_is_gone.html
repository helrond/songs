<div class="lyrics">I know a man who only talks on rotary phones<br />
Full of numbers, memories and poems<br />
He knows what tomorrow will bring<br />
Tomorrow can bring<br />
<br />
I know a man with a head for machines<br />
He's got stories, he's got digital dreams<br />
He's thinking on yesterday<br />
Thinking of yesterday

<div class="chorus">What's gone is gone<br />
What is gone will be again<br />
What's ahead there is nobody knows<br />
It has already been</div>

I know a girl who says all she needs<br />
Is a husband, a home, a family<br />
She knows what tomorrow will bring<br />
Tomorrow can bring<br />
<br />
I know a girl who's got it all<br />
Strength and beauty, she's got lovers at her beck and call<br />
She's thinking on yesterday<br />
Thinking of yesterday

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

In my days here I have tried to match my head<br />
To my heart and to my lungs, to my legs<br />
To hold what tomorrow will bring<br />
Tomorrow can bring<br />
<br />
For the last time I surrender for a song<br />
And the next time I will be long gone<br />
Thinking on yesterday<br />
Thinking of yesterday
