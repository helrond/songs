<div class="lyrics">Pain is not for the pretty<br />
The fair of face and heart<br />
We will all I am told be ugly and old<br />
But pain is not for me<br />
<br />
Work is not for the brilliant<br />
Those with minds strong and free<br />
And though I struggle at times to find a rhyme<br />
Work is not for me<br />
<br />
Friends are not for those beloved<br />
Of the stage or screen<br />
And though I have met with little success<br />
Friends are not for me<br />
<br />
Great deeds are not for the modest<br />
To make their mark on history<br />
We all have our dreams of worldwide regimes<br />
But great deeds are not for me<br />
<br />
The truthful must never be lied to<br />
Lest they hear dishonestly<br />
And though I am told it is more than silver and gold<br />
The truth is not for me</div>
