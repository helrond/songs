<div class="lyrics">I've been a homesick disciple on these rails<br />
Trying to fit my faith to a name<br />
Trying to fit three chord truths into twelve bar blues <br />
I've been trying to stay honest, to stay true

<div class="chorus">Sing me a song Woody Guthrie and I'll be the man in the moon <br />
Sing the sun down out of the sky, the wind right into this room <br />
Sing me water, sing me wine; a song to cast out all fear <br />
Sing me a song Woody Guthrie and I'm leaving, leaving here</div>

I've been over; I've been so long gone<br />
On these end of alphabet songs<br />
I have waited for so long to spit this dust out of my lungs<br />
Untangle my stumbling tongue<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

I went all the way out past the King's Highway<br />
To see what was left, what â€˜'d find of you there<br />
At the end of the street there was nothing; not a home, not a grave<br />
And a rambling man leaves no trail
