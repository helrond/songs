<div class="lyrics">I went out the other day with<br />
A man with a hand with molded clay<br />
Asked him if we've got a shot<br />
He smiled and said I write the plot<br />
<br />
Cursed my fate and it loved the hate<br />
Broke my smile with a rubber file<br />
Cut my sight but the dark took flight<br />
And I saw what I've seen and I wish had never been

<div class="chorus">Just look at us now; one nation under the gun<br />
Just look at us now; we are Adam's only son<br />
Just look at us now; dead last in a race we won<br />
What have we become</div>

Saw a man on the edge of a broken glass<br />
With his face in a knot his eyes in a bind and his heart in the past<br />
Jump and live he'll jump and die<br />
Maybe he won't but just as soon try
