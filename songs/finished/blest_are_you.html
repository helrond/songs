<div class="lyrics">Maybe I could fly if I could get up off my knees<br />
I could swim if I weren't trapped under this sea<br />
Maybe this desert will dry up in my dreams<br />
And this song will drown out the screams

<div class="chorus">Call me weak<br />
Call me fool<br />
What he said was<br />
Blest are you</div>

I had a woman down in Mexico<br />
Things were hard and one day she let go<br />
Now I run from the cloud that covers me<br />
Get on board I'm bound for glory

<div class="chorus">Call me weak<br />
Call me fool<br />
What he said was<br />
Blest are you</div>

It's much brighter than you'd think down here<br />
I can see further than you'd think from so near<br />
Maybe one day I'll get up on that silver screen<br />
And end these days of falling in between<br />

<div class="chorus">Call me weak<br />
Call me fool<br />
What he said was<br />
Blest are you</div></div>
