<div class="lyrics">You can walk across this country <br />
You can walk around the world<br />
You can walk until you can't feel your feet<br />
You can walk to the world's end<br />
You can walk back home and <br />
But you can't walk half a day with me

<div class="chorus">And you'll never get to these convictions<br />
Don't even try<br />
Disprove these predictions<br />
Or are you just going to die</div>

You can call me a criminal<br />
Before I even get tried<br />
Call me a menace to society<br />
You can find me guilty<br />
In a matter of minutes<br />
You can lock me up and throw away the key

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

My kids call me daddy <br />
And my wife calls me dear<br />
And to God I'm just another son<br />
But you gave me a number<br />
And you locked me in a cage<br />
You don't even look like you're having fun
