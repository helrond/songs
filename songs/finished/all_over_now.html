<div class="lyrics">Saw it for a dime in 1943<br />
At the Palestine Theater down on Clinton Street<br />
Tumbleweeds in black and white, a Picture in Grey<br />
Jean and Hopsy, Heaven Can Wait<br />

<div class="chorus">It's all over now<br />
It's all over now<br />
It's all over now but the history</div>

Bought it cheap and sold it on a whim<br />
You won't hear that 78 again<br />
And 5 LPs got that phonograph for free<br />
Blonde on Blonde, the Stones and the Supremes<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS<br /></div>

Got it every day down at the corner store<br />
The news that's fit to print and nothing more<br />
Atom bombs and Communists, Brown and the Board<br />
The National Guard in Arkansas<br />
