There's a man at my door, says he has come to heal us<br />
And everybody knows Holy Ghost Power<br />
<br />
There's a man at my door, says he has come collecting<br />
There's a man at my door, says who were you expecting<br />
And everybody knows Holy Ghost Power

Where you gonna run to <br />
Where you gonna run to</div>

There's a man at my door, says he belongs to Jesus<br />
There's a man at my door, says he has come to heal us<br />
And everybody knows Holy Ghost Power</div>
