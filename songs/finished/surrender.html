<div class="lyrics">The way you wear your life like it's something you have won<br />
And the way you've given in on the things not yet begun<br />
I am casting about to find the right words to say<br />
To fill your nets and calm your waves

<div class="chorus">So how you gonna win you can't beat this thing<br />
By drawing lines in the sand<br />
So if you want out the only way now<br />
Is to throw in your hand</div>

So you can go and fight that war for a spot on which to stand<br />
You can rape and pillage, loot and burn turn cities into sand<br />
And you can touch the lips of Helen make war on Genghis Khan<br />
But the Gates of Heaven still stand strong

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

So you want to make yourself holy and free <br />
And love like a hurricane or a symphony<br />
After all of this do you still wait for a sign<br />
A potion or a line

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
