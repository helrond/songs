Place the blame on anybody<br />
Claim that you don't care<br />
Say the world is lost forever<br />
But don't say you're scared<br />

Say you'll move to Canada<br />
You'll never vote again<br />
But don't say you're scared forever</div>

<div class="lyrics">Don't fear tomorrow <br />
don't bow down<br />
Do not be frightened<br /> 
of any power<br />
Don't fear the dawning<br />
Don't be cowed<br />
Do not be frightened<br />
Of any power
