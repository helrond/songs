I wake up with my stomach in knots and my ears ringing<br />
I should not be feeling this way first thing in the morning<br />
With my back bent into a curve and a wobble in my knees<br />
A spirit as flat as my feet<br />
<br />
Lead me out into the night in those wild places<br />
The shoulders of the highway in those high lonely days<br />
<br />
Grit my teeth and clench my fists<br />
Slumped shoulders<br />
Bad habits<br />
<br />
Got to get out of survival mode<br />
<br />
Not even Joe can make me believe<br />
<br />
Cracking up<br />
<br />
Thank God for loneliness<br />
<br />
Struggling to sit up straight<br />
<br />
<div class="chorus">Letting it all go to waste<br />
I can't go on living in an altered state<br />
Living in an altered state of blue</div>
<div class="chords">CHORUS: <br />
Am/G/Am<br />
C/G/F/G<br />
C/G/Am</div>
