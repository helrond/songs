I was born with a silver spoon in my hand<br />
Tell the world to lay it down<br />
Talk of real estate just passes over my head<br />
And I lay it down
I've walked a mile in my sleep<br />
On broken glass and concrete<br />
Brothers, sisters, lay it down<br />
<br />
You don't have time for this tales of distant conflict <br />
CEO-ldier, lay it down <br />
We don't see eye to eye you know the bottom line<br />
Helicopters on the ground<br />
You say you know the cost what's sold can never be lost <br />
CEO-ldier lay it down <br />
<br />
I was born with my back against a wall<br />
Come on Cisco lay it down<br />
I got justice on my side and vengeance on my mind<br />
Come on Cisco lay it down<br />
<br />
Need some answers<br />
I've got 9 to 5 cancer<br />
Come on Cisco lay it down<br />
<br />
There's a line on the edge of town it starts ________________<br />
Hey Cisco lay it down<br />
<br />
Where are all the unions<br />
In the black it's got me blue man<br />
Hey Cisco lay it down
