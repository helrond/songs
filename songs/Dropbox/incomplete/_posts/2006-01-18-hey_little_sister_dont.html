Hey little sister don't, don't let them do this to you<br />
Hey little sister don't, don't let them do this to you<br />
Those things you're believing are not real<br />
Don't let them do this to you<br />
<br />
Hey little sister don't, don't believe what it tells you<br />
Hey little sister don't, don't believe what it tells you<br />
You are occupied territory<br />
Don't believe what it tells you

<div class="chorus">It is true that our bodies fail us<br />
And Lord, so do our minds<br />
But passing on all of the blame<br />
Is the worst kind of lie</div>

Hey little sister don't, don't let them do this to you<br />
Hey little sister don't, don't let them do this to you<br />
Those things you're believing are not real<br />
Don't let them do this to you
