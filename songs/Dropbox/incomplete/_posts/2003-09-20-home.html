There are times to get back to basics<br />
And this is one of those<br />
Food water air and love<br />
And you, you alone<br />
<br />
There are times when not much matters<br />
And this is one of those<br />
I could even throw my life away<br />
For you, you alone<br />
<br />
I'm happy being your lover<br />
I'm fine with being your friend<br />
But if there was just one thing that I could be<br />
I'd want to be your home<br />
<br />
I know that I'm your lover<br />
I know I am your friend<br />
But what I really want to know is<br />
Am I your home
