Old men, you've got it hard<br>
Filled up with losses, wealthy in scars<br>
Paying for wisdom with regrets<br>
Old men, you're not done yet<br>
<br>
Old men, everything aches<br>
When life starts giving less than it takes<br>
And the cold sets deep in your bones<br>
Old men, you're almost home<br>
<br>
Old men, life's cashed you in
Trading friendships for medicine<br>
And things start to break before they bend<br>
Old men, it's not the end<br>
<<<<<<< HEAD

knowledge is a lot to bear
=======
<br>
Old men, you have not spent<br>
All of your courage or confidence<br>
Or traded in your will to live<br>
Old men, there's more to give<br>
