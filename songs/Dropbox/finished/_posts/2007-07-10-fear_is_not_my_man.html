There was glass everywhere when she came down the stairs<br />
And she got on her knees in the yard<br />
And she cleaned up that place with a Colt .38<br />
Stuck in the small of her back

<div class="chorus">No man could compare to her<br />
In heart or hand<br />
I don't need no champion she said<br />
Fear is not my man, no,<br />
Fear is not my man</div>

Was a May afternoon when that whistle blew<br />
And he died in the factory blast<br />
She raised two Jimmy Deans and a homecoming queen<br />
All on her own<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When she came to me it was not out of need<br />
But a land of plenty and faith<br />
No small kind of love and no stars far above<br />
Would ever direct her feet

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/G/Am/F<br />
C/G/C<br />
C/G/Am/F<br />
C/G/C<br />
<br />
C/G/F/C<br />
C/G/Am<br />
C/G/F/C<br />
C/G/Am/F<br />
