I'm tired of love songs<br />
One more packaged torn soul<br />
I want nothing more nothing less than the whole<br />
<br />
Through your stained glass eyes<br />
You tell me you have nothing to hide<br />
But I know better than that<br />
<br />
And I look to the other side light<br />
And I find myself hanging out tight<br />
Hold up the roof and hold down the floor<br />
Push out the windows and pull in the door<br />
<br />
'Cause it's a hard day living this life<br />
It's a hard night when you've lost your sight<br />
It's a hard time losing it slow as you can
