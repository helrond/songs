Believe me<br />
I wanted to find it in people<br />
Believe me I tried<br />
Believe me<br />
I wanted to trust in the interest<br />
In payment for my time

<div class="chorus">Disappointed<br />
Disappointed again</div>

Believe me<br />
I wanted to keep it together<br />
Polite and cool<br />
Believe me<br />
I wanted to stay in control<br />
Rely on the rules

<div class="chorus">Disappointed<br />
Disappointed again</div>

Believe me<br />
I wanted to make it through<br />
Without ugliness<br />
Believe me<br />
I wanted to stand above it<br />
Do better than this

<div class="chorus">Disappointed<br />
Disappointed again</div>
