You are a liar<br />
When you turned to me and said<br />
Turned to me and said<br />
<br />
Here it is; my desire<br />
In shades of blue and green and red<br />
Blue and green and red

<div class="chorus">If I knew what you would find<br />
In the eyes of my own mind<br />
I would have been so much less kind<br />
My camera</div>

You are much wiser<br />
Than you have any right to be<br />
Any right to be<br />
<br />
Back then things were brighter<br />
And they came on easily<br />
Came on easily

<div class="chorus">When I saw what could be blamed<br />
On the light and on the frame<br />
I should have dropped you without shame<br />
My camera</div>

You are a reminder<br />
Of the desert and the sea<br />
The mountains and the streams<br />
<br />
After this what you require<br />
Is nothing that you need<br />
Nothing that you need

<div class="chorus">If we've looked and disagreed<br />
On the way things go from here<br />
You have always been sincere<br />
My camera</div>
