I'll be damned if I will believe this after all the shit you said<br />
You've been lying like a thrift store suit and it don't fit you well<br />
You've gone and shouted wolf one too many times<br />
I'll be damned if I believe this I'll be damned if he is dead

<div class="chorus">I'm breaking orbit, cutting into speed<br />
Gone independent of petty gravity<br />
Dawn is descending, I'm abdicating dreams<br />
On Independence Day</div>

You're kings of wind and thunder and lords of the tomb<br />
You'll crack the bell of freedom and blow the trump of doom<br />
I'll scream it like a banshee if you tear out my tongue<br />
The spheres they danced a two-step on your kingdom coming down

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The sun bounced down off the brass on your chest and it nearly made me blind<br />
But the demons under the porch laughed at your beautiful lies<br />
I'll walk right through this fire and I won't even smell of death<br />
The sun came down on a summer day but I am not deaf or blind

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">C/G/F/C/E/ Am/G<br />
C/G/F/C/E/Am<br />
C/G/F/G<br />
C/G/F/C/F/G/C<br />

Am/G/Dm/G<br />
Am/G/Dm/G/<br />
