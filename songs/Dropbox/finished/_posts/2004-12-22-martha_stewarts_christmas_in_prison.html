<div class="notes">Trippel/Arnold via John Prine</div>
It was Christmas in prison and the food ain't real good<br />
I had turkey and pistols carved out of wood<br />
I done tried some baking but it's hard without cream<br />
My brands on your shelf, and my show's on your screen.

<div class="chorus">Wait aw	hile for my return to TV<br />
The Department of Justice has nothing on me<br />
Email me, cell phone me, dump the shares now<br />
I'm wheelin' and dealin' and appealin', by God</div>

My website has posted a Holiday greetin'<br />
So please buy my china though I won't be eatin'<br />
My heart is as big as this whole goddamn jail<br />
But I'll let Omnimedia drop the coin for my bail<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The search light in the big yard swings round with the gun<br />
And spotlights the snowflakes like the dust in the sun<br />
It's Christmas in prison there'll be music tonight<br />
I'll probably get homesick I love you, goodnight.
