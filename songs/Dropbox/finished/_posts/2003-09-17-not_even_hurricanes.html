Tonight will be sleepless again<br />
Waiting for the sound of the rain<br />
For the wind to lift and the tide to shift<br />
For the strength to cast my cares adrift<br />
But tonight I will dream of you

<div class="chorus">Because I know not even hurricanes could blow me away<br />
From this place that I have let myself into<br />
And I know not even hurricanes could blow me away<br />
I am bound for the sky and bound to you</div>

Tonight will be restless again<br />
Waiting for the words to proclaim<br />
For the waves to part for the Holy Ark <br />
For courage to be pure of heart<br />
But tonight I will dream of you

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Tonight I will be dreaming again<br />
Hearing the sound of your name<br />
Though the seas may rage and the sun may fade Â <br />
And though my heart may pace its cage<br />
Tonight I will dream of you
