When the barricades were silent and the royal guards lay dead<br />
When Marie Antoinette lost her head<br />
They took up the king's library<br />
And wrote down the books on aces and threes

<div class="chorus">This was a house of wisdom<br />
This was a house of perfection<br />
This was a house of wisdom<br />
Now it's gone</div>

Its holdings built on theft and toil<br />
The world's wisdom gathered within its walls<br />
All those scrolls of authority<br />
Lost to a fires and changing regimes<br />
<br />
It was said that the Catholics were to blame<br />
As the General Letter Office went up in flames<br />
The royal court cowered, the Lord Mayor fled<br />
The people left homeless, their letters unsent<br />
<br />
The Tigris ran black; the city lay waste<br />
The ruler was trampled, his statues defaced<br />
Pages bled as palaces burned<br />
The wisdom of centuries was unlearned
