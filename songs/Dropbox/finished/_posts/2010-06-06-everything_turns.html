They go on everywhere<br />
Turning up in the air<br />
Bearing spirits all unaware<br />
Going on everywhere<br />
<br />
And the bones will awake<br />
They will dance they will shake<br />
Find their partners and mend all their breaks<br />
And the bones will awake

<div class="chorus">Everything turns<br />
Everything breaks, rises and burns<br />
Everything turns<br />
We will return</div>

All the shaky dreams<br />
All the numbers and wheels<br />
All the visions disguised as sleep<br />
All the shaky dreams<br />
<br />
Watch your doors and your gates<br />
Bake the bread, shed your hate<br />
They will not touch you with fire or fate<br />
Guard the doors and the gates

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When you turn to the truth<br />
Say the words I am you<br />
Befriend emptiness love the obscured <br />
When you turn towards truth

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Am/G/Am<br />
Am/G/C<br />
Am/G/C/Am<br />
Am/G/Am<br />
(Am/F/G)<br />
<br />
C/G/Am/G<br />
F/C/Am/G<br />
C/G/Am/G<br />
C/G/C</div>
