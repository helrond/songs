Look around this mountainside<br />
Look where the red tail flies<br />
On the rooftops far below<br />
See the first signs of snow<br />
<br />
Wish I had a home on high<br />
Wish I was the burning sky<br />
Wish I was the falling rain<br />
Wish I had no other name<br />
<br />
When I first came to this place<br />
I was looking for your face<br />
If I pass this way again<br />
I will think of you my friend<br />
<br />
When the creeks have all run dry<br />
Then you'll see her pass on by<br />
In this place her wisdom speak<br />
Where the waters cannot reach<br />
<br />
Look around this mountainside<br />
Let your thoughts grow free and wild<br />
Look around where you belong<br />
Feel the harmony, the song
