Got me a pair of brand new walking shoes<br />
And I'll be gone by the time you hear the news<br />
And if I get to Pittsburgh you will never catch me then cause I<br />
Got me a pair of brand new walking shoes<br />
<br />
Got me forty acres of bottom land<br />
Underneath the river that you dammed<br />
All the corn and beans I raised washed right down the drain<br />
Got me forty acres of bottom land<br />
<br />
Got me a Colt .45<br />
There's no place in this world you can hide<br />
Nowhere left for you to run from all the wrong that you have done<br />
Got me a Colt .45<br />
<br />
I've got heaven on my side<br />
And justice will not be denied<br />
I left him lying there and I looked into his eyes, I said<br />
I've got heaven on my side<br />
<br />
Got me a pair of brand new walking shoes<br />
And I'll be gone by the time you hear the news<br />
And if I get to Pittsburgh you will never catch me then cause I<br />
Got me a pair of brand new walking shoes
