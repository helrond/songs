On the road my friend<br />
On the road my friend<br />
There'll be trouble 'round every bend<br />
On the road my friend<br />
<br />
On the road my friend<br />
On the road my friend<br />
You'll meet beauty and drown all your sin<br />
On the road my friend<br />
<br />
On the road my friend<br />
On the road my friend<br />
Every step leads you on to the end<br />
On the road my friend<br />
<br />
On the road my friend<br />
On the road my friend<br />
You'll find heaven around every bend<br />
On the road my friend
