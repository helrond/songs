It's the place on the corner with the broken glass and the burned out light<br />
Go down that street to the second light and make a right<br />
Stay on that and it'll take you out of this dismal part of town<br />
Go to the bright lights and night flights of downtown

<div class="chorus">I know what you're looking for<br />
You won't find it anywhere here<br />
I know what you're looking for and I<br />
Think you want to go<br />
Downtown</div>

They got the marble, we got steel, they are the puppets, we are real<br />
We got water we can't drink, they have a place, and they think<br />
You know, I kind of like this city: got a lot of class, not too gritty<br />
We walk on glass and choke on air and think of ways to get out of here

<div class="chorus">I know what you're looking for<br />
You won't find it anywhere here<br />
I know what you're looking for and I<br />
Think you want to go<br />
Downtown</div>

In these streets so pothole filled, it' another day gone and another one dead<br />
You pay the rich to rob the poor, then ask if they want to take the tour<br />
You're dressed up in suits and ties - full up on greed and lies<br />
A golden goose, a juggling clown, and big salaries who go downtown<br />
<br />
Go downtown...
