Started out when the leaves were changing<br />
Blood on the railroad tracks<br />
Started out, man I was not stopping<br />
I held a rifle in my hand<br />
<br />
All the way through Mingo County<br />
Hound dogs are set on me<br />
My face posted from here to Texas<br />
Felts' goon squad at my heels

<div class="chorus">And the law it brings you down<br />
And the law kicks you around <br />
And the law it busts this union town<br />
On this killing ground</div>

I have been too brave, too frightened<br />
I have lost, I have found<br />
Now this town is burned to cinders<br />
My home made a killing ground

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Started out when the leaves were falling<br />
Aching heart and itching hand<br />
Started out, man I won't be stopping<br />
Until we've reached the Promised Land

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Fdim/C/G/Am<br />
<br />
F//G//C/G/Am</div>
