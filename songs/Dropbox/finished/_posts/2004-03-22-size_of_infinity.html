As if I could say he's not my president to be cleared of any crime<br />
As if the only cause worth fighting for is my own private life<br />
As if I could say that walking away is just acting polite<br />
As if you were wrong and I was right

<div class="chorus">I've been losing faith in the things that carry me<br />
Losing my hope in the unseen<br />
Losing love for my leaders but I still believe <br />
In the size of infinity</div>

As if I could say things would be different with a change in regime<br />
As if I could further both a compromise and my integrity<br />
As if the color of my blood is purple and not red<br />
As if I was good and you were bad<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

As if I could say that when I'm on my knees it's not idolatry<br />
As if all there is to happiness is life and liberty<br />
As if I could shrug and say the truth is what you lie about<br />
As if I was in and you were out

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">G/D/Em/C/G/D/G<br />
G/D/Em/C/G/D/G<br />
C/D/G/C/Em<br />
C/D/C/G<br />
<br />
C/G<br />
D/G<br />
C/G<br />
D/C/G</div>
