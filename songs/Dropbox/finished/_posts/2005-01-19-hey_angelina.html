Angelina says to me<br />
There's nothing left to do<br />
And so she pours the coffee out<br />
And cries the whole day through<br />
<br />
Angelina says to me<br />
There's nothing left to say<br />
And so she lies about her age<br />
And sleeps the livelong day

<div class="chorus">If the sky should fill with fire hey Angelina don't cry<br />
The tide run out the stakes run high hey Angelina don't cry<br />
The gilded cross the bloody eye hey Angelina don't cry<br />
The time has come to choose your side hey Angelina don't cry</div>

Angelina says that she's<br />
Been driven from her home<br />
And no one listens anymore<br />
To that old jawbone<br />
<br />
Angelina says that she<br />
Has seen this all before<br />
And there's no need for her to try<br />
To get up off the floor

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">A/D/A/D/A/D/E/A<br />
