Staring at the ceiling it's a wonder it don't fall<br />
As if that were some comfort at all<br />
Thinking of the future I am worried all the time<br />
The weather, water and the signs

<div class="chorus">The world keeps turning round releasing fears<br />
Direction fades and motion disappears<br />
We go laughing on to the end<br />
Pushing past the last threshold of time<br />
Turning all our failures into shrines<br />
Inheritance known as a gift</div>

Standing on the mountain and you're praying it would burn<br />
For some mercy in return<br />
Kneeling by the river you've been begging for rain<br />
That all might be forgiven again<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Shouting at the sky like you can bring it down<br />
And there would be some higher ground<br />
Dimes in the fountain yeah you threw it all away<br />
In words destined to fade

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Em/G/D/Em<br />
C/G/D<br />
<br />
Am/G<br />
Am/G<br />
Am/G/D</div>
