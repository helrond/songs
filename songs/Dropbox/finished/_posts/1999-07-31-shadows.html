On those hot summer nights years ago<br />
We played flashlight hide and go seek<br />
Turned ourselves into monsters<br />
And ran from the shadow behind the trees<br />
<br />
The shadows grew up with me<br />
Hid under my bed, hung from the walls<br />
Hid in my books got on the bus with me<br />
And if i let them, chased me down the halls<br />
<br />
You tell me I'm psycho, tell me I'm crazy<br />
These shadows are things no one can see<br />
I say you're the one that is crazy<br />
There's on your shoulder talking to me

<div class="chorus">Tonight -- I ask what is sight<br />
What I see -- can't just be me<br />
Tonight I -- need a bright light<br />
So I know -- which are the shadows</div>

You find them everywhere you'd expect<br />
A dumpster, a prison, a whorehouse, a bar<br />
Sometimes you find them in the bright lights<br />
Yesterday i saw one at the altar

<div class="chorus">Tonight -- I ask what is sight<br />
What I see -- can't just be me<br />
Tonight I -- need a bright light<br />
So I know -- which are the shadows</div>
