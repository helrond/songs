There ain't nothing on the TV, it's Friday night<br />
And this old house is cold dark and quiet<br />
I am sad and lonely, I am missing you<br />
I've got hours to kill but I've got nothing to do

<div class="chorus">I don't want no golden apples <br />
I don't need half of the moon<br />
I just want your time; give me an hour or two<br />
I wanna get drunk, I wanna get drunk with you</div>

So what will it be girl; your place or mine<br />
Whiskey, rum, tequila, bourbon, vodka, beer or wine<br />
It comes in cans or bottles, has many different names<br />
But drinking alone it just ain't the same

<div class="chorus">I don't want no golden apples <br />
I don't need half of the moon<br />
It's very simple, here's what I want to do<br />
I wanna get drunk, I wanna get drunk with you</div>

So if you're feeling lonesome if you're sad and blue<br />
If this world has got you down, here's the thing to do<br />
Call me up, I'm waiting, I will be there<br />
I'll bring my own bottle and I'll even let you share

<div class="chorus">I don't want no golden apples <br />
I don't need half of the moon<br />
If you're sad, I've got a cure<br />
I wanna get drunk, I wanna get drunk with you</div>
