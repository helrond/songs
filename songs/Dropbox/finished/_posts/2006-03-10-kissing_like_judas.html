It was underneath the willows on a sultry night in June<br />
I went walking with my true love out underneath that moon<br />
We tickled and we tussled, we huggled and we kissed<br />
Oh girl you looked like Minnie Pearl, but you kissed just like Judas

<div class="chorus">Hey hey hey hey what can I say<br />
She tore me up, she led me astray<br />
Hey hey hey hey what could I do<br />
She was unfaithful, she was untrue</div>

It was earlier that spring when our courting had commenced<br />
When I first had kissed her across the old stone fence<br />
She would send me love letter written in verse<br />
Oh girl you wrote like William Shakespeare, but you kissed just like Judas<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Then it was autumn, I was running from the law<br />
I had shot and killed a man who had cheated my grandpa<br />
She said that she would lie for me no matter who would ask<br />
Oh girl you spoke like Jesse James, but you kissed just like Judas<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

So the moral of this story for those still listening<br />
Is don't mistake truth and kisses, lovers and friends<br />
If somebody should say they'd gladly die for you<br />
Remember they told that to Jesus too

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
