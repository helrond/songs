You got me crawling on the floor you got me begging for more<br />
See what you do to me<br />
You got me about to lose my mind you got me dying all the time<br />
See what you do to me<br />
And when I say that I want to be your man<br />
I'm running naked through the town<br />
See what you do to me<br />
<br />
You got me singing in the rain you got me shouting out your name <br />
See what you do to me<br />
You got me praying in the dark you got me naked in the park<br />
See what you do to me<br />
I when I say that I have no more to lose<br />
I mean that I have to be with you<br />
See what you do to me<br />
<br />
You got me falling on my knees you got me begging please<br />
See what you do to me<br />
You got me feeling like a king you got me wanting it again<br />
See what you do to me<br />
And when I say that I'll give you all I can<br />
I'll throw my life like water onto sand<br />
See what you do to me
