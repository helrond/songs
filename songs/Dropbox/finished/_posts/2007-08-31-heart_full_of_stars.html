Compared to some you've been around<br />
But goodbyes still get you down<br />
Never one to break the news<br />
And I know how you bruise<br />
<br />
You've got ways to hold it in<br />
To betray the best of things<br />
All that rage and all that love<br />
You can never get enough

<div class="chorus">And each time you hit the wall<br />
You stumble and you fall<br />
Just remember who you are<br />
And your heart full of stars<br />
You can buy a brand new car<br />
Drive it fast and drive it hard<br />
But you'll never get too far running from your scars<br />
And your heart full of stars</div>Oh your heart and your shoes<br />
They will go just where they choose<br />
They will let loose their strings<br />
You will get tangled in

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You move on from place to place<br />
As if to test the grasp of grace<br />
But your smiles and your tears<br />
Are two things I still believe

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">Am/F/C/G<br />
Am/F/C/G<br />
Am/F/C/G<br />
C/G/C/F/C<br />
<br />
Am/F<br />
G/F<br />
G/F<br />
C/F/C</div>
