The fridge buzzes, the rocking chair groans<br />
Kettle has boiled dry as a bone<br />
Lists and deadlines should be running through my mind<br />
But I sit here thinking of you<br />
<br />
I've got the great American novel in my head<br />
A lifetime of books to be read<br />
There's a song in the headlines screaming to be born<br />
And I sit here thinking of you<br />
<br />
There are dishes to be washed and bills to pay<br />
There's a world to be saved<br />
But you can find me here doing what I do best<br />
Sitting and thinking of you
