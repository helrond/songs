<div class="notes">for Craig</div>
I met a ghost<br/>
    And I thought it was me<br/>
    Mighty like Casey, with bowling balls for knees<br/>
    I met a ghost<br/>
    And it looked a lot like me<br/>
    In the hand of Michaelangelo, wearing Abe Lincoln's beard<br/>
    <br/>
    I met a ghost<br/>
    and he said to me<br/>
    Said I've got a hand made out of poetry and a head made of steel<br/>
    I'm in love<br/>
    And I can't stop this disease<br/>
    They are crawling out my fingertips, I am a ghost factory<br/>
<div class="chorus">
    I met a ghost yeah<br/>
    I met a ghost<br/>
    I met a ghost yeah<br/>
    A ghost yeah a ghost<br/>
I met a ghost</div>

I met a ghost<br/>
And I knew it was me<br/>
He said I've got a heart, I beg you, don't believe<br/>
Me I'm old <br/>
And I'm showing my years<br/>
My heart is angry and distracted; a buzzing sack of bees<br/>
