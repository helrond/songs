One glance from you was all it took<br />
One word I did not understand<br />
And your laughter cut me off right at the knees<br />
Laid me out to die on the sand<br />

<div class="chorus">
So I built myself a tower<br />
And I climbed up to the top<br />
But it all came tumbling down</div>

-<br />
And we are locked inside our walls<br />
And we look out our own windows<br />
And we can only walk out our own doors<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

But we know all of the loopholes and all of the cracks<br />
The tunnels and the fords into the heart<br />
The weaknesses to our defense<br />
The places where we break apart<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
