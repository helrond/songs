The daffodils on the kitchen table<br>
Are leaning toward the light<br>
By this time tomorrow<br>
They will have died<br>
<br>
I was walking down Eighth Avenue<br>
On the day you died<br>
I knew exactly when it happened<br>
By the change in the light<br>
<br>
I've always felt uneasy with my feet off the ground<br>
<br>
It takes time for my head and stomach to catch up with a change in altitude
