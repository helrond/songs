Maybe I was right where I was right then
But in two years I'll be gone
And maybe all the places I've been to
Only served to bring me here

<div class="chorus">Maybe I was right
Maybe I was right
Maybe I was right
I was wrong</div>

Maybe all the things that I have lost
Make room for the new
Maybe all the people I forgot
I was not meant to know

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Maybe the ideals that I have lost
Were the ones I don't believe
Maybe all the anger that is gone
Was not sincerely felt
<div class="chords">C/Am
F/Dm

C/Am/C/G</div>

Maybe all the things that I regret

Not the waiting, but the preparedness

Confidence/assurity that I have lost

Remember something else 

Mistakes I knew better than to make
