Old men, you've got it hard
Filled up with losses, wealthy in scars
Paying for wisdom with regrets
Old men, you're not done yet

Old men, everything aches
When life starts giving less than it takes
And the cold sets deep in your bones
Old men, you're almost home

Old men, life's cashed you in
Trading friendships for medicine
And things start to break before they bend
Old men, it's not the end

Old men, you have not spent
All of your courage or confidence
Or traded in your will to live
Old men, there's more to give
