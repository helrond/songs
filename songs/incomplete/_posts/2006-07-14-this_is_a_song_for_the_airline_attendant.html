This is a song for the airline attendant<br />
Who brought me this pen when I asked her to lend it<br />
I thought she’d forgotten like she forgot the tea<br />
For the woman in the seat next to me<br />
<br />
But she didn’t, and I’ve got this pen that writes well<br />
And it has the name of Radisson Hotels<br />
I’ve never stayed there, though I’m sure it is nice<br />
And this plane ride is bumpy and the clouds are white<br />
<br />
This is a song for the stewardess<br />
I don’t know her name, but I know I could guess<br />
Or I could just look at that take that she wears<br />
But everyone knows it’s rude to stare<br />
<br />
It was thanks to her that I wrote these words<br />
On a flight to Charlotte, which is nice I have heard<br />
I am out of space and out of lines<br />
So this is the end, this song is over, but it’s mine
