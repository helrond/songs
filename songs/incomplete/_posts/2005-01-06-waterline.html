We were down on the shore that evening<br />
Walking the waterline<br />
A voice was calling up from the deep saying run<br />
Leave your troubles behind<br />
<br />
We were down on the shore that evening<br />
Walking the waterline<br />
You were calling to me you spoke my name<br />
You said leave your future behind<br />

Forty days on the sea are nothing<br />
It’s the nights that will do you in<br />
Watching the wake fade into the sea<br />
Erasing where you have been<br />
<br />
Forty days in pursuit of a cloud<br />
At night a pillar of fire<br />
The wind at your back blows over your footsteps<br />
The past creeping up from behind<br />
<br />
You can’t cut a line into water<br />
Part the seas with a wave of your hand<br />
<br />
It’s too deep for your anchor to hold<br />
<br />
We’ve been two of a kind it’s true<br />
<br />
If I’m caught in this flood give me strength<br />
Not to struggle or swim<br />
Let me drown like a stone let me surrender<br />
Let me give in<br />
<br />
Is this divine intention or human design<br />
Are we out of step with this creation or<br />
Right in time
