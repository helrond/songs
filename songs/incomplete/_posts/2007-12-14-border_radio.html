You can't pay to hear it anymore<br />
Even if you wanted to<br />
And you can't hear it on the radio<br />
-<br />

<div class="chorus">Turn it on, tune on it<br />
It will bring you to your knees and into sin<br />
Blasting birds right out of the say<br />
That border radio</div>

DJs are afraid<br />
Wolfman<br />
AP and the girls<br />
On the X

<div class="chords">C/F/C<br />
