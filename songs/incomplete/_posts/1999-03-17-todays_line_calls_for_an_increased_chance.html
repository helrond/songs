today's line calls for an increased chance<br />
clouded sun, popular indifference<br />
a shot of blood and a pint of hate<br />
sharks rising to the scent of the bait

<div class="chorus">give me half a chance<br />
to gain my omnipotence<br />
give yourself a chance<br />
to be more than indifferent<br />
peace is taken out to die<br />
hope is falling from the sky<br />
joy is lost in the river's fall<br />
as justice takes the final call</div>

when did love become hate's favorite game<br />
and peace a way of staying sane<br />
children - collateral damage in our wars<br />
i wish that i could say it wasn't my fault
