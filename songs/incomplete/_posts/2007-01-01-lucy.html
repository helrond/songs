Neither incumbent nor activist<br />
<br />
Finally I have learned<br />
In every moment and task a chance<br />
For the smallness of transcendence<br />
<br />
Every moment has a soul<br />
Every job deserves to be the only one<br />
<br />
Living is not an art, it is a craft<br />
<br />
Do the thing you’re doing really well<br />
<br />
Forget about averages and history<br />
Tides and ripples and echoes and memory<br />
What your grandchildren will think of me<br />
<br />
Once it starts to sway there’s only one way it can go<br />
<br />
After all, who needs eyes to see<br />
And diamonds will never make you believe<br />
<br />
Butterfly effect<br />
<br />
vanishing day
