There's a lot of people about what kind of mess we're in<br>
And people offering advice for which nobody asked them<br>
And people building dams, putting in wells and pumps<br>
But when the flood comes, the water's going to run where it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, you better find a boat<br>
When the flood comes down, something that floats<br>
When the flood comes down, you better hang on tight to it</div>

There's talk about public health and decency<br>
Respect for law and order and property<br>
People going through the trash, building levees out of junk<br>
But when the flood comes, the water's going to cover what it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, you better hold the fort<br>
When the flood comes down, shut down the port<br>
When the flood comes down, you better let it go where it wants</div>

Some people live on nothing, some people got everything<br>
Some people pay attention, some people never learn a thing<br>
Some people claim to be something they are not<br>
But when the flood comes, the water's going to drown who it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, break down your solutions<br>
When the flood comes down, wash out your institutions<br>
When the flood comes down, it will carve its own path to the sea<br>
When the flood comes down, from whatever's coming<br>
When the flood comes down, there is no use in running<br>
When the flood comes down, we will get exactly what we deserve</div>
