<div class="notes">at Occupy Wall Street</div>
On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)<br>
Will you remember what happened here (oh oh)<br>
People sitting down and speaking their minds (oh oh oh)<br>
Facing resistance on every side (oh oh)<br>
But I know <br>
And I know <br>
It still moves<br>
<br>
On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)<br>
Reach out and take a hold of me (oh oh)<br>
<br>
<br>
But I won't<br>
No I won't<br>
Go alone<br>
<br>
On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)<br>
The rain is coming down on me (oh oh)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)<br>
Barricades on every street (oh oh)<br>
<br>
<br>
But I'm told<br>
Yes I'm told<br>
There's room to grow<br>
