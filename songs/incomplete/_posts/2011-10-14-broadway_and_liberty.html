<div class="notes">at Occupy Wall Street</div>
On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)<br>
There is something happening here (oh oh)<br>
People speaking their minds (oh oh oh)<br>
Facing resistance on every side (oh oh)<br>
But I know <br>
And I know <br>

On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)<br>
Reach out and take a hold of me (oh oh)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)<br>
Rain and snow will not bother me (oh oh)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

On Broadway and Liberty (oh oh oh)<br>
Barricades on every street (oh oh)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
