Silence reigns in the beauty parlor<br />
Rusting Russian tanks and empty American shells<br />

<div class="chorus">Cash in Kabul (You know where we're at man)<br />
Cash in Kabul (All day long)<br />
Cash in Kabul (I just want the facts man)<br />
Cash in Kabul (All night long)</div>

And I walked in holding my guidebook<br />
<br />
If I am an immigrant in my own country<br />
Then what am I here
