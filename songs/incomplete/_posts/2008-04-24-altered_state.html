I wake up with my stomach in knots and my ears ringing
I should not be feeling this way first thing in the morning
With my back bent into a curve and a wobble in my knees
A spirit as flat as my feet

Lead me out into the night in those wild places
The shoulders of the highway in those high lonely days

Grit my teeth and clench my fists
Slumped shoulders
Bad habits

Got to get out of survival mode

Not even Joe can make me believe

Cracking up

Thank God for loneliness

Struggling to sit up straight

<div class="chorus">Letting it all go to waste
I can't go on living in an altered state
Living in an altered state of blue</div>
<div class="chords">CHORUS: 
Am/G/Am
C/G/F/G
C/G/Am</div>
