Stanwyck dot cat<br />
Lying on the mat<br />
You could never kill a rat<br />
You are too slow and fat<br />
<br />
Stanwyck dot cat<br />
What do you know<br />
Are you a genius<br />
Do you think humans are slow<br />
<br />
Stanwyck dot cat<br />
You’re a pretty girl<br />
All the kitty boys<br />
Want to get into your world<br />
<br />
Stanwyck dot cat<br />
You’re sleepy and sweet<br />
What would you sat to me<br />
If you could speak
