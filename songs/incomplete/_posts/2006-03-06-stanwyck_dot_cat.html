Stanwyck dot cat
Lying on the mat
You could never kill a rat
You are too slow and fat

Stanwyck dot cat
What do you know
Are you a genius
Do you think humans are slow

Stanwyck dot cat
You're a pretty girl
All the kitty boys
Want to get into your world

Stanwyck dot cat
You're sleepy and sweet
What would you sat to me
If you could speak
