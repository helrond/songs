Gotta keep walking that righteous road<br />
Gotta take up that heavy load<br />
Pick your head up off the floor<br />
Get your feet out of the door

<div class="chorus">Make your way out of the city<br />
Make your way across town</div>

Gotta keep walking that righteous road<br />
Gotta believe the things I know<br />
Takes more than this world can bring<br />
To find out the shape Iâ€™m in

<div class="chorus">Make your way from consolation<br />
Make your way through rocky ground</div>

Gotta keep walking that righteous road<br />
Gotta lay down that heavy load<br />
Forget about the things you lose<br />
Make your life some kind of use

<div class="chorus">Make your way from all concession<br />
Make your way back to yourself
<div class="chords">
Am/C/G/F<br />
<br />
Am/G<br />
Am/G</div>
