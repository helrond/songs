Even Jesus had twelve men and you have yours too<br />
A Judas, a Thomas, a Mark and maybe even a Luke<br />
There are twelve months to each year twelve hours to each day<br />
And I have but twelve breaths left to speak all the words I have left to say<br />
<br />
All the twelve tables of law and steps to a higher place<br />
Were of very little use of me when I stopped counting at twelfth grade<br />
But the twelve Federal Banks can’t hold the love I feel<br />
The Army of Twelve Monkeys can’t tell me this is not for real<br />
<br />
The Greeks had twelve gods for every possible event<br />
And the past is far behind us now but what can it help to prevent<br />
There is a stone for every month of the year and I’ve carried them since<br />
I did my twelve Herculean tasks in atonement for my sins<br />

There are twelve days of Christmas and only one true love<br />
Twelve tribes of Israel but only one true God<br />
And as much as I try to tell myself who you are is not who you’ve been<br />
There are still twelve of them and only one of me
