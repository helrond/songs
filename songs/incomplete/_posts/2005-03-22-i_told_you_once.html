I told you once<br />
I’m not saying it again<br />
You either step back off yourself<br />
Or you’ll be dealing with my friends<br />
<br />
I told you once<br />
It’s not funny anymore<br />
You better drop that shit this second<br />
Or I’m walking out the door<br />
<br />
Now you’re screaming bloody murder<br />
Like a pig who just got stuck<br />
Here’s a quarter, go call someone<br />
‘Cause I don’t give a fuck<br />
<br />
So you’re scared<br />
Hell aren’t we all<br />
Get your head out of your ass and<br />
Get your feet back on the floor<br />
<br />
And if you’ve got a cross I’ve got a shoulder to lean it on<br />
Go on and lay your burden down, it’s not heavy, it’s not _________<br />
I’ve heard this one before, it goes ABC<br />
It’s the same fucking song, in a slightly different key
