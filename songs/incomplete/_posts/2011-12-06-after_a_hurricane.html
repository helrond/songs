<div class="notes">for Albertville</div>
There were limbs down everywhere and those trees ain't coming back<br>
And people without power three weeks after the fact<br>
But on Sunday when it ripped through town like a runaway train<br>
There was nowhere to be but in your bathtub praying<br>

<div class="chorus">You will have to think twice about where to turn that wheel<br>
You will have to get used to the way things look from here<br>
Because nothing you know will ever be the same<br>
After a hurricane</div>

After it was over, when all the lights were out<br>
And you could get back to the road and get back into town<br>
Well they closed down the highway; cops were turning folks around<br>
That's when it hit you what had happened somehow

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The governor declared a state and called out the Guard<br>
And the President dropped by to let us know we would survive<br>
But we sweated out that summer in the Alabama sun<br>
Unemployed and with no way to pay for what had to be done

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords"></div>
