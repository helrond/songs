You would sit there for hours talking to yourself<br />
And the words would flow right out of you like a fountain, like a well<br />
You would sit there for hours talking to yourself<br />
Things would fold and spin and shatter; I know, I was there

<div class="chorus">Oh you had me brother<br />
You sang so sweet<br />
Oh those words my brother<br />
Underneath that tree<br />
<br />
Oh this world is wheels in wheels<br />
Wings and waterfalls<br />
Secrets I will never know<br />
And names yet to be called</div>

You would sit there for hours facing east<br />
All the agents of empire came on bended knee<br />
You would sit there for hours facing east<br />
And all the nations streamed towards you<br />
From the greatest to the least<br />
<br />
You would sit there for hours in the shade of that tree<br />
At the head of the river looking out towards the sea<br />
You would sit there for hours in the shade of that tree<br />
And in the silence of that morning I fell onto my knees
