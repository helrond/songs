The wind blew down the avenue all night long<br />
And it blew down a limb of the St. Nicholas Elm<br />
Hundreds of years gone to splinters and dust<br />
What was left on the ground I picked it up<br />
<br />
You say lately things have been going to hell<br />
There is less to be known and nothing to tell<br />
Your body is failing to back up your mind<br />
And you canâ€™t trust your eyesight most of the time

<div class="chorus">Nothing lasts forever in these seasons or this weather<br />
Everything falls apart<br />
The world just keeps on spinning without reason or beginnings<br />
And I've got to find my place and my part</div>

Like Washington you stood your ground<br />
As New York City burned on down<br />
You stood by the trail where traders passed<br />
An island was lost for trinkets of glass<br />
<br />
And when we are gone our parting will be<br />
A change in displacement, a scent on the breeze<br />
Cracking and twisting with everything else<br />
We are decaying miracles from our birth<br />
<br />
Voices of nature and prophecy
