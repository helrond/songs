    <br/>
    Desperate people will do anything<br/>
    If a door is locked they will kick it in<br/>
    And if you dare to cross them, you will see<br/>
    Desperate people are dangerous and mean<br/>
    <br/>
    Desperate people will believe in anything<br/>
    <br/>
    Desperate people are up for anything<br/>
    <br/>
    Desperate people aren't scared of anything<br/>
    <br/>
    
    <div class="chorus">
    (voice file0007)<br/>
    So if you keep my belly full and keep me dry and warm<br/>
    Let me have enough so I can worry about it<br/>
    I won't start a scene, a revolution or a war<br/>
        Desperate people do desperate things</div>

I've got just enough to keep me from being desperate<br/>
    <br/>
    My anxiety is the color of money<br/>
    <br/>
can't be free with a safety net<br/>
