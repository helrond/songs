<div class="notes">for Craig</div>

I met a ghost
And I thought that it was me
Mighty like Casey, with Ezekiel's knees
I met a ghost
And it looked a lot like me
In the hand of Michaelangelo, wearing Abe Lincoln's beard

I met a ghost
Blowing smoke into the breeze
Had a hand made out of poetry and a head made of steel
Said I'm in love
And I can't stop this disease
They are crawling out my fingertips, I am a ghost factory

<div class="chorus">I met a ghost yeah
I met a ghost
I met a ghost yeah
A ghost yeah a ghost
I met a ghost</div>

I met a ghost
And I knew it was me
He said I've got a heart, I beg you, don't believe
Me I'm old
And I'm showing my years
My heart is angry and distracted; a buzzing sack of bees
