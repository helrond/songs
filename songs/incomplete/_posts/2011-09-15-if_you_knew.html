If you knew what they were saying about you
Would you smile for the camera or turn your face away
If you knew how people worried over you
What would you do and what would you say

If you knew what they were planning for you
Would you up and fly away
If you knew the tricks they've got for you
Would you be gone by the end of the day

You will do what you came here to do
Place our minds in you

I would never insult love by calling it mine.
