There’s a rule for every number<br />
And a place for everything<br />
There’s a word for every notion<br />
A perfect description

<div class="chorus">Well nothing is everything<br />
And anyway there is not one thing you could do to make me believe<br />
The numbers never lie</div>

Mr. Dewey we don’t need you anymore<br />
So pack up your papers and leave<br />
You take your numbers, I’ll take my time<br />
Consider it a deal<br />

That is no way to live a life; in an<br />
Alphabetical scheme<br />
Every time you write it down<br />
Please remember me<br />
<br />
I won’t ask you what you want it for<br />
