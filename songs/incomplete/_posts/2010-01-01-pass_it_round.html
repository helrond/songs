Take it down off the wall and pass it round
Don't leave anything useful lying round
And whatever you can spend is enough to get you in
To keep everything going round

<div class="chorus">Pass it round, pass it round
There's so many empty bottles in this town
If you know how to fix what's broke, if you can pay more than you owe
And what you want to receive, pass it round</div>

Paying for your share

If like me your mind's a bum, let it go rambling on

Anyone can say anything and I will be listening

Food
Booze
Music (an instrument)
Friends (what I know about you depends on who I heard it through)
Ideas
