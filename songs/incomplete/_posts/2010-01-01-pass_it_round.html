Take it down off the wall and pass it round<br />
Don’t leave anything useful lying round<br />
And whatever you can spend is enough to get you in<br />
To keep everything going round

<div class="chorus">Pass it round, pass it round<br />
There’s so many empty bottles in this town<br />
If you know how to fix what’s broke, if you can pay more than you owe<br />
And what you want to receive, pass it round</div>

Paying for your share<br />
<br />
If like me your mind’s a bum, let it go rambling on<br />
<br />
Anyone can say anything and I will be listening<br />
<br />
Food<br />
Booze<br />
Music (an instrument)<br />
Friends (what I know about you depends on who I heard it through)<br />
