When the iron curtain fell I was standing there<br />
More surprised than I cared to admit<br />
<br />
When the borders were closed I was sitting there opposed<br />
<br />
<br />
When the verdict came down I was kneeling on the ground<br />
My head in my hands<br />
<br />
Asymetry<br />
Sanctions<br />
<br />
What is here and what is beyond<br />
<br />
You can leave my failed aggression dangling<br />
<br />
I know you have tried to hide your hatred<br />
And I for my part have forgotten how much I love you
