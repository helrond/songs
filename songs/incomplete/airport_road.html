<div class="lyrics">Take it four lanes wide all the way<br />
At ninety miles per hour<br />
Tumbleweeds blow down ambush alley<br />
And it will blow your confidence down<br />

<div class="chorus">Airport Road you stole my brother<br />
Airport Road you took my friend<br />
You say take it easy but you do not deceive me<br />
I am not going back there again</div>

Out on the highway just past midnight<br />
The asphalt is cold as hell<br />
There's a man standing there with a rock in each hand<br />
And he's praying to Allah for help<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

And though I drive down Route Irish<br />
I will not be afraid<br />
A gunner in the turret<br />
Is my comfort and aid</div>
