I work in a refrigerator, I am your ice box man<br>
I work in a refrigerator, I am an ice box man<br>
When I touch you honey, can't even feel my hands<br>
<br>
I've got dirty fingers and I've got dirty hands<br>
Yeah I've got dirty fingers yeah I've got dirty hands<br>
I try and wash them but they're so filthy, man<br>
<br>
My teeth are rattling, my toes are blocks of ice<br>
My teeth are rattling, my toes are blocks of ice<br>
I love you baby, keep me warm at night<br>
<br>
I've got icicles dangling off my ears<br>
Yeah I've got icicles dangling off my ears<br>
I need some fire, baby, I need some body heat<br>
<br>
I work in a refrigerator, I am your ice box man<br>
I work in a refrigerator, I am an ice box man<br>
When I touch you honey, can't even feel my hands<br>
