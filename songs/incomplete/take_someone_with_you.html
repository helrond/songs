<div class="lyrics">I've got friends who say that they're always alone<br />
And there is nowhere left to go<br />
The have all been everywhere<br />
But none of them have left their home

<div class="chorus">Put on your traveling shoes<br />
Get off the highway, turn off the news<br />
Go somewhere you've never been and<br />
Take someone with you</div>

There are certain songs that cannot be sung alone<br />
And stories that cannot be told<br />
And you can never hope to sell<br />
All the things you've got to tell<br />
<br />
Home is always somewhere in between<br />
Our feet and the ground</div>
