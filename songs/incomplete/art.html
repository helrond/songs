<div class="lyrics">You were looking at the sky and talking of God<br />
At you feet a flower bloomed and heaven grew from mud<br />
You were looking at the sky and speaking holy words<br />
While the sacred passed unspoken and unheard<br />

<div class="chorus">It takes courage to see beauty but it takes faith to let it show<br />
You have love to give the whole world but you despise your fractured soul<br />
And if there is a savior he loves the things both small and weak<br />
The arc of the horizon the mud beneath your feet</div>

You were looking at the wall and scales fell from your eyes<br />
And you fell off of your horse and fell into this life<br />
You were staring into space and then you heard the sound<br />
You got up and left behind that winning hand<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You have told me often and I know it is true<br />
That art is for the sake of live and beauty is not truth<br />
I am saying to you that living is an art<br />
And love is more than giving, it is faith in your own heart<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
