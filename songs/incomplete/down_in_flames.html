<div class="notes">"In the words of the prophet Isaiah, “Lift your eyes and look to the heavens who created all these. He who brings out the starry hosts one by one and calls them, each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing."
-G. W. Bush</div>
<div class="lyrics">It’s the smallest things that kill when you’re in outer space<br />
<br />
Thirty-eight miles high a cowboy rides the clear blue sky over eastern Texas<br />
His silver ship and his gleaming gun reflecting morning sunlight<br />
His face is radiant <br />
So before it all ends in a flash of light brighter than the sun<br />
<br />
Debris raining down over Nagacdoches<br />
<br />
Countdown clock counting up<br />
<br />
