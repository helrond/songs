<div class="lyrics">He says I told him something I should have kept to myself<br />
I say secrets are so fucking contagious<br />
<br />
Listening to Joe Strummer feel the distance to the Nile<br />
And the cruise control set at seventy five<br />
<br />
Business corridors<br />
<br />
Heading west and leaving the city behind<br />
At seventy miles an hour<br />
<br />
Moosic and the Promised Land State Park<br />
<br />
Put it out of gear and let it roll <br />
Let the wind take the lead for a verse or two<br />
-<br />
Finding lines in the passing air<br />
<br />
Fragments of retreads stranded on the shoulder<br />
Circling vultures<br />
Crows dive bombing hawks<br />
<br />
Out here we’re all the colors of our cars<br />
And we’re singing along to the radio<br />
<br />
Joe Hardy - 84 Lumber<br />
<br />
Watershed, township, county, V for turkey vulture<br />
<br />
90’s music charts, buckle up for the next million miles</div>
