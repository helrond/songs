<div class="lyrics">I know the sun is shining somewhere<br />
I know tomorrow’s never far away<br />
I know the skies are blue in Boston<br />
But New York City is cold and gray

I know it’s true		fact is stranger than fiction
I know it’s true		the amazing things I’ve heard
I know it’s true		we have exceeded all prediction
I know it’s true		this is a beautiful world

I know I’m going to quit this drinking<br />
I know my life is going to make some sense<br />
-<br />
I know I am still innocent<br />
<br />
I know I can rely on happy endings<br />
You play Romeo, I’ll be Juliet<br />
<br />
I know that we have nothing but this moment<br />
But right now sucks and tomorrow probably will<br />
<br />
Did you know slugs have 4 noses<br />
Goldfish have ADD<br />
That camels have 3 eyelids<br />
Fish cough like you and me</div>
