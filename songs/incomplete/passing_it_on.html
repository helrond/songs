<div class="lyrics">We came in through the door off the car port<br />
The one that always sticks<br />
The answering machine was blinking<br />
On the bed were the grandkids' unwrapped gifts<br />
<br />
There were lists on the refrigerator<br />
And the calendar was covered in names<br />
It was snowing in March in Alabama<br />
As if we needed a reminder things had changed

<div class="chorus">I still think of you<br />
What was left behind after you'd gone<br />
It's not a matter of blame or credit<br />
But passing it on</div>

And the messages were automated calls<br />
On behalf of your pharmacist<br />
While I was restless, going room to room<br />
Sure there was something I had missed

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

There was a stack of bills in the closet<br />
Bibles and westerns on the shelf<br />
And we looked for reasons and tried to find ways<br />
For our hearts to hold things they can't bear<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div></div>
