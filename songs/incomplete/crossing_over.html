Well you can shake and swerve and shimmy until you jump right off the tracks<br />
And they'll leave you burning there after watching the crash<br />
But if you wait for the right moment, guard the throttle, grease the joints<br />
You'll be crossing over at the switching point<br />

<div class="chorus">
Keep your hand on the throttle<br />
Pay with patience for time<br />
And you will cross over easy to another line<br /></div>

Find someone to sing to<br />
<br />
Not to get high; to make the miles<br />
