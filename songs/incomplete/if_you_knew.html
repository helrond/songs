If you knew what they were saying about you<br>
Would you smile for the camera or turn your face away<br>
If you knew how people worried over you<br>
What would you do and what would you say<br>
<br>
If you knew what they were planning for you<br>
Would you up and fly away<br>
If you knew the tricks they've got for you<br>
Would you be gone by the end of the day<br>
<br>
You will do what you came here to do<br>
Place our minds in you<br>
<br>
I would never insult love by calling it mine.<br>
