In life you sought illicit loves<br />
Divorced future kings<br />
Now you're the "People's Princess". you're<br />
Flying on angelic wings

<div class="chorus">Death kills our heroes weakness<br />
Puts haloes on their heads<br />
Erases uncomfortable memories<br />
And we like our heroes dead</div>
