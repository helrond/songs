I left you alone<br />
I left you cold<br />
I left you dead<br />
I left you with a hole in your head<br />
I left you with a piece of lead<br />
I left you in the lake you bled<br />
I left you with your hand on the phone<br />
I left you all alone<br />
<br />
You give me life<br />
You give me peace<br />
You give me blood<br />
You give release<br />
You made me laugh<br />
You made me cry<br />
I made you scream<br />
I made you die<br />
I made you beg<br />
I waved goodbye

<div class="chorus">You won’t find me on the highway<br />
Going 65<br />
Everything is going my way<br />
I’m alive<br />
<br />
I know my dad would be proud of me<br />
I know my mom still loves me<br />
I know that you won’t feel a thing<br />
A know the way that blood can sing<br />
<br />
Don’t look over your shoulder<br />
Keep your eyes on the road ahead<br />
By the time you see me<br />
You’ll already be dead<br />
<br />
Life’s too short to be nobody<br />
<br />
Life’s too short not to die<br />
<br />
When I was young</div>

Are you after me<br />
Are you after you<br />
Are you after my life<br />
Are you after yours too<br />
Are you after my mind<br />
Are you after my head<br />
Are you after my thoughts<br />
And the books I have read<br />
I am after you<br />
I am after me<br />
I am after your blood<br />
I am after your plea<br />
I am after your home<br />
I am after your life<br />
I am after your kid<br />
I am after your wife<br />
<br />
I am after fame <br />
I am after TV<br />
I am after success<br />
I want to be seen<br />
I am after faith <br />
I am after hope<br />
I am after love<br />
I am after dope
