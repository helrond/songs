5 seconds after I walk out the door<br />
I miss you<br />
Right after I hang up the phone<br />
I miss you<br />
-<br />
-<br />
<br />
When skies are cloudy and its pouring rain<br />
When I am singing under sunny skies<br />
When I'm all alone by myself at night<br />
When I'm packed in the bus on a rainy day<br />
