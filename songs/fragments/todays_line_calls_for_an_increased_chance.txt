3/17/99

today's line calls for an increased chance
clouded sun, popular indifference
a shot of blood and a pint of hate
sharks rising to the scent of the bait

give me half a chance
to gain my omnipotence
give yourself a chance
to be more than indifferent
peace is taken out to die
hope is falling from the sky
joy is lost in the river's fall
as justice takes the final call

when did love become hate's favorite game
and peace a way of staying sane
children - collateral damage in our wars
i wish that i could say it wasn't my fault
