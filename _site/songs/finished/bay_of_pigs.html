<strong>Bay of Pigs</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
When you moved on the face of the waters, when you spoke into the void<br />
When the waters parted by sands of time, when silence echoed of noise<br />
It was then that you walked by the seashore casting out demons with a wave of your hand <br />
A stranger called out your name, he said you are the son of man<br />
And you cannot bind me, no I am not bound, I am Legion this world is my own<br />
You said, come my brother you were born to trouble and now I set you free <br />
The water is wide the water is troubled<br />
The water is fouled with the blood of 2 thousand<br />
All across this bay, the bay of pigs<br />
<br />
When the scent of danger hangs in the air like the sweetest lilac flower<br />
When foreign interests bears its teeth, when blood lusts and fears<br />
It was then that you flew over water to incite a civil war<br />
And all along was failure planned or was it who you were fighting for<br />
And no one has chosen, and you did not choose your time of birth or place<br />
It is not between two countries that freedom takes its stake<br />
The water is wide the water is troubled<br />
The water is fouled with the blood of 2 thousand<br />
All across this bay, the bay of pigs<br />
<br />
When I was drowning in rivers of sin and sinking in cold dark waters<br />
When I had walked into a place that I couldn't walk back out of<br />
It was then I saw him stretch out his hand to consecrate the water<br />
All the fish swam to the nets like it was the home that they'd always thought of<br />
And he said, to me leave your guns leave your butter; bread is for beggars and roses for lovers <br />
So come, come to the waters and live<br />
The water is wide the water is troubled<br />
The water is fouled with the blood of 2 thousand<br />
All across this bay, the bay of pigs
