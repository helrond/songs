The bells are ringing down in the valley ringing for my wife<br />
The bells are ringing down in the valley ringing for my wife<br />
I'm in the mountains testing the edge of my knife<br />
I met my love in the cornfields in the month of June<br />
I met my love in the cornfields in the month of June<br />
Then came July, I said we met too soon<br />
<br />
Crops are ruined, ain't no harvest, there was a terrible drought<br />
Crops are ruined, ain't no harvest, there was a terrible drought<br />
The things you need are the things you gotta do without<br />
He drinks whiskey every evening, sleeps through the day<br />
He drinks whiskey every evening, sleeps through the day<br />
My old man has been digging his life away<br />
 <br />
The Senator came to our town, drove up and down, gave a great speech<br />
The Senator came to our town, drove up and down, gave a great speech<br />
That's the last we heard of him till he was impeached<br />
Billy joined the army, had a baby, went off to die in the war<br />
Billy joined the army, had a baby, went off to die in the war<br />
We all say he can sin no more
