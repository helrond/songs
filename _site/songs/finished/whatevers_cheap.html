Some folks they like whiskey others like their wine<br />
Some they just drink Budweiser and others Natty Light<br />
But when I slide up to the bar just one drink works for me<br />
I say to the bartender I'll have whatever's cheap

<div class="chorus">Sometimes you need the President, sometimes you need the King<br />
Sometimes you will just open up and let the Beast right in<br />
Beggars can't be choosers, and nothing's ever free<br />
Just say to the bartender you'll have whatever's cheap</div>

Some folks they like women with diamonds and pearls<br />
And some they like their men dressed up like girls<br />
Either way don't matter much just when we're out to eat<br />
They say to the waiter I'll have whatever's cheap

<div class="chorus">Sometimes you'll eat with Senators, sometimes you'll eat with hogs<br />
Sometimes you'll be so hungry you could eat your old hound dog<br />
Beggars can't be choosers, and nothing's ever free<br />
Just say to the waiter you'll have whatever's cheap</div>

Some folks go to church and some they stay at home<br />
Some don't believe in God at all some call Satan their own<br />
If you step up to the altar and he asks you what you need<br />
Just say to the preacher I'll have whatever's cheap

<div class="chorus">Heaven is a Motel 6 and the sign says vacancy<br />
Jesus gave out loaves and fishes down by the sea<br />
The Staten Island Ferry is swinging down for me<br />
And if you want salvation you can have it 'cause it's free</div>
