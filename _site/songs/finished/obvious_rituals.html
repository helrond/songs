	<div class="lyrics">
These walls are screaming out things about you and your honesty<br />
I watched as you pulled your mother down said babe I got what you need<br />
The alien who flew in on a red-eye from Portland is drinking up all of your gin<br />
Your disciples say they want wine from water but you have been living in sin<br />
<br />
They lied when they told you there's 12 steps to heaven and I will be meeting you there<br />
They lied and they said you could stop when you wanted but I know you haven't a prayer<br />
The bastards they said there was money in dreams and it was yours to be had<br />
But you took the bait, hook, line and sinker and now you can't go back

<div class="chorus">It's not like it was before<br />
It's not like heaven at all<br />
It's not like it was before<br />
It's not like heaven will fall</div>

I've heard that your condition advanced and you cannot be saved<br />
I got nothing but reasonable suspicion of those who say they're for you babe<br />
If you want to sing with the angels you can't sin with the beasts<br />
Believe but take full precaution that your faith decrease

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

<div class="chorus">And one man's desert is another man's well<br />
One man's heaven is another man's hell</div>

I heard you at my back door last night begging for a hit<br />
If you're looking for America I think this isn't it<br />
And this isn't London or Paris France and this isn't Kalamazoo<br />
It's not what you wanted it's not what you need but you're going to have to make do

<div class="chorus">CHORUS<br />
<br />
Blood is thicker than water oil is thicker than blood<br />
Clouds turn into rain rain turns dirt to mud</div>

You sit like a board in the corner with nothing to say<br />
You act like you can't hear me talk but your lips are turning gray<br />
Honey I know your plans to conquer the universe<br />
You're smoking hashish with the Shah of Iran and fighting unquenchable thirst<br />
You can swim in the sea, fly to the sun, run with the wind<br />
But you're about to hit rock bottom and you won't bounce my friend

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
<div class="chords">VERSE: Dm/Am/E/Am<br />
CHORUS: C/Am/F/G<br />
BRIDGE: Am/G/F/E</div>
