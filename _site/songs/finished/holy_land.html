	<div class="lyrics">
Stop said the man listen and you will hear<br />
There's a wind blowing out of the east and it's bringing fear<br />
You've got to get off and walk and learn a new way to talk<br />
You're going to have to learn to say goodbye

<div class="chorus">There's not much here that isn't holy land<br />
Take off your shoes take notice where you stand<br />
And all around you this is holy ground<br />
Give up your speculations, your demands</div>

Stop said the man I will tell you what you lack<br />
When you lose your way you must ask to get it back<br />
You've got to get down on your knees if you really want to see<br />
Got to let them look you in the eye

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Stop said the man, listen and do not fear<br />
There's a wind blowing out of the east and it's already here<br />
There's a lot to understand if you want to be a better man<br />
So much to which you'll have to say goodbye
