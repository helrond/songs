	<div class="lyrics">
My baby's gone and left me for another<br />
And I've never been so sad and blue<br />
My baby's left me here to sit and wonder<br />
Why she won't be true<br />
<br />
I saw her last Friday evening<br />
She said that I had been replaced<br />
Somebody with more to offer<br />
Had taken my rightful place

<div class="chorus">He's got big brown eyes, curly hair, she says he listens well<br />
Doesn't cuss, doesn't scratch, he hardly even smells <br />
I've tried to hide my head in sand but it is plain to see <br />
She loves her teddy more than she loves me</div>

Forgive me if I am jealous<br />
If I oil my gun and whet my Bowie knife<br />
I swear to God I've never been indecent<br />
But he's been sleeping with her all of her life

<div class="chorus">He's got big brown eyes, curly hair, doesn't smoke or drink<br />
Doesn't cuss, doesn't scratch, he don't tell her what to think<br />
I've tried to hide my head in sand but it is plain to see <br />
She loves her teddy more than she loves me</div>

I've been trying to comprehend my failings<br />
Understand the error of my ways<br />
It's hard to win when you're competing<br />
With a bear who's got a head start in the race

<div class="chorus">He's got big brown eyes, curly hair, doesn't kiss and tell<br />
Doesn't cuss, doesn't scratch, he hardly even smells<br />
I've tried to hide my head in sand but it is plain to see <br />
She loves her teddy more than she loves me</div>
