<div class="notes">Words and music by Hillel Arnold and Josh Gardner</div>

With half of Texas blowing off to the east<br />
And the other half stuck to my feet<br />
Took what was left of my love and money<br />
And headed for the sea<br />
<br />
If it rained for forty days <br />
I don't believe this desert would bloom <br />
If I find better luck in the city<br />
I'll sing it to a picture of you

<div class="chorus">What I owe is more than I can render<br />
What I owe is buried in the desert sand <br />
What I owe is lost and gone forever <br />
What I owe is who I am</div>

With all to show for five years labor<br />
A hard luck nickel and my name<br />
Hopped the freight, the old South Central<br />
And headed for those fertile plains <br />
<br />
My descendents for seven generations <br />
Are promised to the factory store <br />
What was real I gave to my real friends <br />
If I could I'd give them some more

<div class="chorus">What I owe is more than I can render<br />
What I owe is buried in the desert sand <br />
What I owe is lost and gone forever <br />
What I owe is who I am</div>

All I have is the song I sing; it binds us you and me <br />
From California to New York Island, I'm always with my family<br />
I'm on my way just like I went, weary, broke and cold<br />
Been down so far so long that it's the only thing I know

<div class="chorus">What I owe is more than I can render<br />
What I owe is signed in a stranger's hand <br />
What I owe is lost and I don't remember <br />
What I owe is who I am</div>
