	<div class="lyrics">
She was born on the banks of the Tennessee<br />
She was raised by the TVA<br />
And she stole her first kiss on the levee bridge<br />
The night they took him away<br />
<br />
He was born and bred on Buzzards Bay<br />
As Yankee as they come<br />
But when he made it down to Birmingham<br />
He finally felt at home

<div class="chorus">North and South<br />
Breathe it in, let it out<br />
North and South<br />
I could never leave you now</div>

He was always out of rhythm<br />
With those big city ways<br />
And when the snow was falling down<br />
He dreamt of warmer days<br />
<br />
They called her Yanqui in San Salvador<br />
Her family thought her strange<br />
And anyway that she behaved<br />
Her voice gave her away

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You took the highway, you headed my way<br />
You drove through the night<br />
And I was home free, I had your country<br />
Locked in my sights
