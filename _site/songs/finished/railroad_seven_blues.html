This train is no good for anyone<br />
This train is no good for anyone<br />
It will run you down and wreck your mind, take all your money and your time<br />
This train is no good for anyone<br />
<br />
I heard that lonesome train whistle blow<br />
Yes I heard that long and lonesome whistle blow<br />
I was sitting by the riverside thinking up a way to die<br />
When I heard that lonesome train whistle blow<br />
<br />
The engineer he spoke to me by name<br />
That engineer he called me by my name<br />
Said get up son and follow me, leave behind your dignity<br />
That engineer he spoke my name<br />
<br />
Look what these rails done to me<br />
Honey, look what these rails done to me<br />
Robbed me of my will to live, everything that I could give<br />
Look what these steel rails done to me<br />
<br />
I hear her now she's coming down the line<br />
Yes I hear her now a-coming down the line<br />
She's straining all her steel and nerve, leaning hard into that curve<br />
I hear that train a-coming down the line<br />
<br />
This train is no good for anyone<br />
This train is no good for anyone<br />
It will run you down and wreck your mind, take all your money and your time<br />
This train is no good for anyone
