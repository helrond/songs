I was sitting on a park bench looking at the clouds thinking to myself about the war<br />
When I heard the distant thunder and headed for home I was halfway there when it commenced to pour<br />
I turned to the nearest house to take refuge from the storm I was already soaked to the skin<br />
I saw an ancient mansion looming large out of the mist and I knew that they would let me in<br />
I raised my hand to knock but the door opened wide to fine Italian wine and candlelight<br />
The lady of the house in her fine satin gown bade me in to spend the night

<div class="chorus">Before I could think to ask she said, "Leave anytime you want<br />
This ain't no hotel and this ain't California I ain't your long-lost aunt"</div>

I sat down with a fireman nursing his scotch who suffered from a curious case of gout<br />
Just then a din broke out in the corridor outside It seems someone had come about a debt<br />
Everybody panicked and headed for hills the fastest way that they knew how<br />
I was stuck there with the fireman, the butler and the maid and the stable hand who milked the Guernsey cow<br />

<div class="chorus">I turned around to look and saw standing in the door someone familiar to me<br />
He'd been tracking me from Phoenix where I'd killed a man or two and all the way through Nashville, Tennessee</div>

If you want to go outside, we can settle this right now I said, cool and calm<br />
He showed a toothy smile and a chill ran down my spine he said, "Don't you remember Vietnam."<br />
I don't got no sympathy for you, Old Lucifer I said, acting tough<br />
He smiled again and then, in a flash, he was gone I was left alone and thought it was a bluff

<div class="chorus">I should have known better than to trust that scoundrel there was a knock upon the door<br />
A second's hesitation did me in they found me laid out on the floor</div>

They handcuffed me and took me in for the first degree and set my bond at fifty grand<br />
And when I called my lawyer who should answer the phone but my long time friend, good old Satan<br />
Is this your notion of revenge, I said, though I was faint and I knew that he had planned this all along<br />
He said, "They're gonna ask for the chair on you, you know yourself your defense is not strong."<br />
I told him he was wrong and the Inquisition failed the government would right this civil wrong<br />
He said don't be to sure my son that anything has changed this world of mine is governed by the strong

<div class="chorus">I couldn't run forever from the hanging judge I knew he would do me in<br />
I couldn't run forever through the rivers and the streams fleeing from my sin</div>

I was sitting in my jail cell looking at the TV thinking to myself about the war<br />
I heard the distant drumbeat and saw the waving flags and I knew that I'd seen it all before
