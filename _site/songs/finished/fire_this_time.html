<strong>The Fire This Time</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
They say parting is such sweet sorrow <br />
To say other would be a lie<br />
But the future that lies before us <br />
Is as dark as the path behind<br />
<br />
They say it's better safe than sorry <br />
In matters such as these<br />
But I tasted the forbidden waters <br />
And suffered not to dream

<div class="chorus">And the fire that lies ahead <br />
Will burn brighter than the fire this time<br />
And the fear of your heart's desire<br />
Will turn your limbs to ice</div>

They say it's only a shot away <br />
To break out of this hypnotic trance<br />
But to await the resurrection <br />
Sinner you've had your chance<br />
<br />
They say that all will be left to memory <br />
The blood stains on the wall<br />
And the screams will fade into silence <br />
Like the smoke trail on the hill

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They have battered your crumbling towers <br />
To your weary heart laid siege<br />
But your womb it still is fertile <br />
And your thoughts they still run free<br />
<br />
They say the kernel must be buried<br />
Or it cannot bear much fruit<br />
But how many must be buried<br />
Before we can bear the truth

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They say parting is such sweet sorrow <br />
More than the heart can hold<br />
And the future that lies before us <br />
Is burning in green and gold
