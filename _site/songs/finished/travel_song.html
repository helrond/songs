	<div class="lyrics">
It's the way the river talks to me at sunrise<br />
It's the faith I have when I am all alone<br />
It's the knowledge that everywhere is nowhere<br />
And I must be going home<br />
<br />
It's the glimpse of the runway before takeoff<br />
Departing points all fading into one<br />
It is knowing that home is for the asking<br />
And there is nowhere left to run

<div class="chorus">And the road it is long<br />
And the road leads me on</div>

It's the way the road is rising up to meet me<br />
It's the truth that I can never escape; you<br />
It's the knowledge of the joy inside each sorrow<br />
The arrival each departure knew<br />
<br />
It's the way all of our ends are our beginnings<br />
It's the way my body returns into dust<br />
It is knowing that all will be forgiven<br />
The enigma of motion and trust

<div class="chorus">And the road it is long<br />
And the road leads me on<br />
And the road it is long<br />
And the road leads me on</div>

It's the way the river talks to me at sunrise<br />
It's the faith I have when I am all alone<br />
It's the knowledge that everywhere is nowhere<br />
And I must be going home
