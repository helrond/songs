	<div class="lyrics">
What did you come in living for what do you go out dying for <br />
It's not this<br />
What did you start out praying for what do you end up craving more<br />
It's not this

<div class="chorus">Say you want to fly away<br />
Say you want to burn all this<br />
Say you want to go astray<br />
You're stuck in bliss</div>

Love turns to hell when there's nothing missing<br />
It's not this<br />
There's no one to talk to when everyone's listening<br />
It's not this

<div class="chorus">One day when it all comes falling down<br />
And you look up to see the higher ground<br />
You'll know you've never been there before<br />
And your heaven is hell and your living won't sell<br />
You a ticket to get through the golden door<br />
<br />
CHORUS</div>

A dream turns to a nightmare when it keeps repeating<br />
It's not this<br />
And even best gestures can't be anything but fleeting<br />
It's not this

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Don't live for this, don't die for this you that something better exists<br />
It's not this<br />
Don't pray for this, don't crave for this your life is worth more than bliss<br />
It's not this
