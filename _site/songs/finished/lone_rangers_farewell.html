<strong>The Lone Ranger's Farewell</strong>

Hasn't rained for forty days, there's brush fires in the hills<br />
The kids are racing turtles, the minister's hooked on pills<br />
They caught me kissing the Sheriff's daughter, and dragged me out of town<br />
Left me on the side of the road I was trying not to drown<br />
<br />
I held my breath as long as I could and when I came up for air<br />
All I saw was an angel perched on a cloud, she smiled and flipped her hair<br />
You've been drinking too much, she said with a smile, that stuff will rot your guts<br />
I muttered something about my luck and stumbled off to my truck<br />
<br />
The engine wouldn't start, the carburetor was shot<br />
And that's when the Lone Ranger rode up and offered me a butt<br />
I said, no thanks, I don't smoke, I'll drink to that, says he<br />
I don't drink neither, says I, but we can take this town by three<br />
<br />
When we rode into town the streets were bare, there was not a soul in sight<br />
I reached into my pocket looking for a light<br />
Just then the kid on the saloon roof squeezes off a shot<br />
All hell breaks loose, it was twenty to one, for a while things were hot<br />
<br />
And when I turned around to look I saw him lying on the ground<br />
Clutching his chest and straining for breath, Death was hanging around<br />
I said, "My friend, we go way back, but I don't want you around this man."<br />
"No hard feelings," he replied, "there's more than enough to go around."<br />
<br />
He screamed until his face turned blue then rolled over and went to sleep<br />
The man could not be bought or sold, he had promises to keep<br />
The last words that I heard him say before he let go <br />
Were "I may come and I may go, but I don't talk of Michelangelo."<br />
<br />
I said, "What do you mean, you don't talk about him <br />
You talk about God and Love and Heaven and Hell and Death and Sin<br />
You talk of the President and talk of the king, you act like there's some use for them<br />
And you even dare to claim innocence, but you don't even know Anias Nin."<br />
<br />
And then as nighttime fell, I stopped and lit a fire<br />
Thunder boomed, lightning split, rain poured from the sky<br />
I headed for the nearest cave, but was stopped by Sheriff Cox<br />
"Where do you think you're going son, and what have you got inside that box?"<br />
<br />
I tried to pass as innocent but the sheriff called my bluff<br />
"That's the man who kissed my daughter," he said, "c'mon, let's string him up!"<br />
They had me all surrounded, there was nowhere I could run<br />
I was dragged down to the County Jail, to be hung at dawn<br />
<br />
And as I was swinging there, facing the dawn<br />
I seen a lot of things no one else saw<br />
I saw Elvis in the gutter, Madonna giving birth<br />
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost digging in the dirt<br />
<br />
I saw the monster rise up dripping from the sea<br />
George Washington telling lies about that cherry tree<br />
Business suits and fathers running from the gun<br />
What they're running to is what they're running from<br />
<br />
And as the clouds rolled over me the sky above grew dark<br />
I screamed, "Don't call me Ishmael, call me Joan of Arc<br />
Don't call me a survivor, don't wish you'd died instead<br />
And far above all else, don't you dare call me dead
