When I was seventeen I was ruthless and mean<br />
And I knew every trick in the book<br />
And I brought close to tears everyone I held dear<br />
When I was seventeen<br />
<br />
When I was twenty one I could not be outdone<br />
And I knew that the world could be saved<br />
And I thought about sin, I haD ideals then<br />
When I was twenty one

<div class="chorus">Oh, I please forgive me<br />
Oh, I was young<br />
Oh, I grow none the wiser<br />
The older I become</div>

When I was twenty four I was reckless and bored<br />
And I stole every word that I spoke<br />
And I could not ignore how it felt to be poor<br />
When I was twenty four<br />
<br />
When I was twenty eight, man I worked every day<br />
And I stayed up late at night<br />
And I practiced my faith and I tried not to hate<br />
When I was twenty eight

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When I am twenty nine I will know what is mine<br />
And I will give it away<br />
And each day I will try to be more like a child<br />
When I am twenty nine

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
