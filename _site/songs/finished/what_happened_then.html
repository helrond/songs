<strong>What Happened Then</strong>

It was the Kingdom of Heaven on the side of the road<br />
A neon sunset, silver and gold<br />
Our throats were parched, dusty and dry<br />
And the beer was of the cold and inexpensive kind<br />
 Jimmy looked at me, I looked at him<br />
 And I don't have to tell you what happened then<br />
<br />
We were mid way through our seventh round when the jukebox started up<br />
Playing Sweet Home Alabama for a gang of biker toughs<br />
And being less than sober I dropped a quarter in<br />
And punched J4, you guessed it, Southern Man<br />
 When that record dropped and when it began to spin<br />
 Well I don't have to tell you what happened then<br />
<br />
There were busted chairs all over and glass everywhere<br />
I was barely conscious, Jimmy almost dead<br />
But when the cops arrived and asked who started this mess<br />
The bartender looked over and nodded at us<br />
 One pulled out his cuffs and one his pad and pen<br />
 And I don't have to tell you what happened then<br />
<br />
They took us to the drunk tank, they tossed us in<br />
With Shane McGowan and the Presidential twins<br />
The jailer came by and a quarter to three<br />
Said boys you've got a visitor, a radical priest<br />
 He was waiting for us with a Newsweek magazine<br />
 And I don't have to tell you what happened then<br />
<br />
That jalopy rattled on through old New Mexico<br />
We were running from the police and that dustbowl<br />
He said they call me Casey and I'm just back from the war<br />
And I've been working for the union since the day I was born<br />
 And when the gun thugs caught us out there on Highway 10<br />
 Well I don't have to tell you what happened then<br />
<br />
I woke up the hold of a dilapidated ship<br />
With a pounding headache and a cask between my lips<br />
We were captained by a man named after a bird<br />
And we were headed for the end of the world<br />
 And just when I thought that things were not looking so grim<br />
 Well, I don't have to tell you what happened then<br />
<br />
The waves came crashing down, the sky opened wide<br />
And in the middle of the ocean there is no place to hide<br />
I must have looked heavy laden with sin<br />
Because they came and took me to the rail and threw me in<br />
 And that leviathan was waiting for me there, my friends<br />
 And I don't have to tell you what happened then<br />
<br />
When I dragged my soggy self up onto the sand<br />
I found Robinson Crusoe there and took him for my man<br />
We were stranded on that island for a year and a day<br />
Until Amelia Earhart came and flew us away<br />
 We were over Kiribati when Tokyo Rose came in<br />
 And I don't have to tell you what happened then<br />
<br />
Well the moral of this story, if such a thing exists<br />
Is to always tell the better part of the news that fits<br />
If your name is nothing, your country a mess<br />
Don't give up 'til you're met with success<br />
 Because it's never over 'til the fat lady sings<br />
 And I shouldn't have to tell you what happened then
