<strong>A Cat Named After a Movie Star</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
You're dumb, you're ugly and yes I'm talking to you<br />
You're weird, you're clumsy, you eat disgusting food<br />
You have no dignity; you act like such a fool<br />
You're dumb, you're ugly I can barely look at you

<div class="chorus">I don't care who you think you are<br />
I'm a cat named after a movie star<br />
I don't care what you think of me<br />
I'm a cat, worship me</div>

That's it, you've done it now, you woke me up again<br />
Dot try to talk to me, I am not listening<br />
Those pigeons are more interesting than you could ever hope to be<br />
I know I'm cute, I know I'm sweet, don't say it again

<div class="chorus">I don't care who you think you are<br />
I'm a cat named after a movie star<br />
I don't care if you think I'm rude<br />
I'm a cat with attitude</div>

I don't mean to be cruel or thoughtless; I'm just telling the truth<br />
There are moments when I actually think I sort of like you<br />
I love that game we play with my mouse, I hide it under the couch and you get it out<br />
And rub my head, now let me go, that will do

<div class="chorus">I don't care who you think you are<br />
I'm a cat named after a movie star<br />
I don't care what you think of that<br />
I'm a cat so kiss my ass</div>
