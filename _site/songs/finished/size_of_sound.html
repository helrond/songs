Belting out the Beatles, Dylan and the Byrds<br />
Singing for his life although he doesn't know the words<br />
It echoed through the darkness when the power died<br />
I can hear him singing now; I believe he's still singing<br />
<br />
That rhythm always came to her clear and strong<br />
Jumping all over Kingdom Come<br />
She brought this hard world right down to its knees<br />
I can hear her singing now; I believe she's still singing

<div class="chorus">Heard it in the thunder, heard it in the rain<br />
Drift through the fences, roll across the plains<br />
Hum through the airwaves and rumble underground<br />
Tell me what could be (what could be)<br />
What could be the size of that sound</div>

Squeezing out the hope in each half-remembered line<br />
Waging war with his fingers and a whiskey-soaked mind<br />
The straight story served with a bad attitude<br />
I can hear him singing now; I believe he's still singing<br />
<br />
Puts her babies down to sleep with a song all her own<br />
Borne across the ocean to this Appalachian town<br />
The sound of harmony, the sound of home<br />
I can hear her singing now; I believe she's still singing

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When he sang hallelujah in that dry and dusty place<br />
Were the very stones shaken by that most amazing grace<br />
The feast for famine, drought for the flood<br />
I can hear him singing now; I believe he's still singing

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
