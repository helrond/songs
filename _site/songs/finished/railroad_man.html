	<div class="lyrics">
He picked up a hammer in his hand said momma I'm off to die<br />
A man against a mountain, muscle at his command<br />
The granite shook his hammer sang as he drove home that spike <br />
They laid him down by the side of the tracks he was a railroad man<br />
<br />
He picked up a guitar in his hand said momma I'm a rambling 'round<br />
A man to bring that thunder with a backbeat and a rhyme <br />
Now he's still looking for that place where milk and honey flow<br />
He could not cure his itching feet he was a railroad man

<div class="chorus">BRIDGE</div>

He picked up a hammer in his hand said momma I'm off to die<br />
A man, a God, a battleground, a tree, a wave on sand<br />
With fire he pierced their cruel hearts with nails they pierced his palms<br />
They say he was a carpenter but he was a railroad man
