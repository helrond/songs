	<div class="lyrics">
Between the lines in a sea of blackness, past telescoping signs<br />
This night was longer than it seemed but I was never tired<br />
The shooting stars were out that night, falling just like rain<br />
I was thinking on the morning, I was thinking things could change

<div class="chorus">Do you want to know what lies behind the mist<br />
Do you want to know how many died for this<br />
Can you tell we are already there<br />
Who would have known there'd be<br />
Roses in November</div>

Take a breath, say a prayer, don't look back, there's nothing there<br />
Did I come here for this, is there something I missed why is no one scared<br />
Read the line, drew the line, crossed it out and crossed over<br />
If your conscience bears no consequence who's left to suffer

<div class="chorus">Do you want to know what lies behind the mist<br />
Do you want to know how many died for this<br />
Can you tell we are already there<br />
Who would have known<br />
Roses in November</div>
