	<div class="lyrics">
Three more days of dust and glory to rid myself of the angel's story<br />
Before I'm thrust to the breaking point before I'm trusted to heal and anoint<br />
Three more days of blood and thunder to sanctify this rape and plunder<br />
To protect your firstborn son to find a target for your gun

<div class="chorus">The world has burned a thousand times and frozen over too<br />
And I suspect our death won't be by knife or wire<br />
We'll go down this time by friendly fire</div>

Three more days to find a savior to find a lover who can raise her<br />
All that you've cast before the swine, all that is laid before these feet of mine<br />
Three more days to turn the mountains into dust and crystal fountains<br />
The blind to see the lame to dance fate cry out to circumstance

<div class="chorus">The world has burned a thousand times and frozen over too<br />
And I suspect our death won't be by knife or wire<br />
We'll go down this time by friendly fire<br />
<br />
sYou say burn baby burn burn baby baby burn<br />
Hell is on the local line<br />
You say burn baby burn burn baby baby burn<br />
Nothing's changed this time</div>

Three more days to suffer treason at the hand of fickle reason<br />
To suffer all that's left to hate to be cursed by all degenerates<br />
Three more days to die completely to all that will defeat you<br />
To come unfettered to the well to be freed from the deadly spell

<div class="chorus">The world has burned a thousand times and frozen over too<br />
And I suspect our death won't be by knife or wire<br />
We'll go down this time by friendly fire<br />
<br />
You say burn baby burn burn baby baby burn<br />
But there's water everywhere<br />
You say burn baby burn burn baby baby burn<br />
And you're consumed by the white whale</div>
