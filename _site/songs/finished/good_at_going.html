	<div class="lyrics">
The first time that you left I was drunk as an eel<br />
The next time I was high as a kite<br />
And this time you could say I was distracted by her face<br />
Looks like it's another lonely night

<div class="chorus">Good at going so wrong<br />
Good at going where I don't belong<br />
Good at going places I shouldn't be<br />
Good at going, that's me</div>

I've been around this world and I've been all over town<br />
I've been to places too low to fall<br />
And now you say you are leaving me today<br />
And I'll be going nowhere at all<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

You say I broke the bond and poisoned our love<br />
You say I have brought you down<br />
Before you walk away and before you cast the blame remember<br />
You're the one that's going now
