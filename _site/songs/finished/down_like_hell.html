<strong>Down Like Hell</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
There's a thousand points of light shining through my window<br />
There's a draft creeping under the door<br />
There's a child left standing at the gates of Hamelin<br />
There's a new tailor for the emperor and<br />
Running won't save you any<br />
Running won't save you any<br />
Running won't save you anymore<br />
<br />
There's a drum that's pounding out a martial rhythm<br />
There's a beggar with a song<br />
There's a lookout shouting iceberg ahoy<br />
There's a band playing on and<br />
Running won't save you any<br />
Running won't save you any<br />
Running won't save you anymore

<div class="chorus">Down down like a fugitive to justice<br />
Down like a stone<br />
Down like fear down like thunder<br />
Down like hell</div>

There's a pilot alone over the south Pacific<br />
There's a tidal wave coming down<br />
There's an army of fools and they're all laughing<br />
There's justice fleeing this town and<br />
Running won't save you any<br />
Running won't save you any<br />
Running won't save you anymore<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

There's a line that's forming for the halls of justice<br />
There a battle for a corporate soul<br />
There's a young man standing at the foot of the altar<br />
There's a country going down the rabbit-hole and<br />
Running won't save you any<br />
Running won't save you any<br />
Running won't save you anymore

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
