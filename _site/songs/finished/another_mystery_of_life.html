	<div class="lyrics">
You say that I should be out on my own now<br />
You say you want to be free<br />
You say that I forced you, you said you have no choice but to<br />
Be what you wanted to be<br />
<br />
You say you don't want me, and then you say you love me<br />
Never told me to leave<br />
You say that you want me to be just who I want to<br />
As long it's really not me<br />
<br />
I want to know just who it is that's talking<br />
The father, the man, or the heavy hand<br />
I want to know just what it is that's talking<br />
Your ego, your past, or your fear of being last

<div class="chorus">What are you saying<br />
Who are you playing<br />
What are you blaming on me</div>

I want you to slow down, I want to go down<br />
I have to get past these routines<br />
If anyone would know that I just can't stand them<br />
It would have to be you</div>
