	<div class="lyrics">
It was the middle of nowhere, sometime after two<br />
I was lost I was blinded by the sun<br />
The map was worse than useless, the compass just points south<br />
The path that I'd come on was gone<br />
I was already weary though I had only begun<br />
Diving into the clouds<br />
<br />
Well I ran to the city but the country followed me<br />
Found me drunk and playing solitaire<br />
Asked where I was headed asked if it was true<br />
That chaos can conquer despair<br />
If there's warmth in concrete you can breathe without air<br />
Diving into the clouds<br />
<br />
I've been always in motion I've been friction's enemy<br />
And home was the road under my feet<br />
Without knowing where it led I took<br />
The path into the heart of the dream<br />
Halfway there I turned around and threw my guidebook down<br />
Diving into the clouds<br />
<br />
It was just south of Texas it was mid afternoon<br />
The sun cut through the clouds with holy fire<br />
It called me to believe in things left unseen<br />
To have faith in the pillars of the sky<br />
Somewhere in between the sky and the sea I am<br />
Diving into the clouds
