<strong>Birmingham Rose</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
She was born the youngest of seven<br />
In a three-room bungalow<br />
Wrestling hurricanes and rattlers<br />
With a rifle and a hoe<br />
<br />
The boys lined up at county fairs<br />
To swing her do-si-do<br />
And with empty pockets, worn out shoes<br />
They crawled off alone<br />

<div class="chorus">None could outsmart or claim her heart<br />
Or follow the way she goes<br />
None is as tender, none is as fierce <br />
As my Birmingham Rose</div>

Grew corn and beans and babies<br />
Out of that rocky ground<br />
And she stood on the porch with that shotgun on her hip<br />
When the taxman came around<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Lost her grandfather to Sherman<br />
And a grandson to Vietnam<br />
She could pick a bale every day<br />
There was iron in those hands<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

They say she's lived forever<br />
They say she'll never die<br />
As long as trees grow from these hills<br />
And rain falls from the sky<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
