	<div class="lyrics">
He's sitting and talking of other days<br />
Better and worse in their own special ways<br />
He's weaving me stories and I'm woven in too<br />
And we're turning back the pages we drew<br />
<br />
We were a man-eating group of first-born kids<br />
No one could survive us, but somehow he did<br />
And he turned us all over and shook out our meanness<br />
Told us just where we were, and we've never been less<br />

<div class="chorus">I say you are my Northern Star</div>

We're scattered all over the face of the globe<br />
But all of us carry the things that we know<br />
That winning sometimes means giving ground<br />
And if you can swim you still can drown

<div class="chorus">I say you are my Northern Star</div>

He sighs and sits back, the story's been told<br />
And I want to be just as wise when I'm old<br />
With the bad came the good, with the good came the bad<br />
But he gave us the best, show us all that we had

<div class="chorus">I say you are my Northern Star<br />
My favorite scar, the best without bar<br />
My Northern Star</div>
