<strong>So Much Sky</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
The light coming down over her shoulder burned my eyes<br />
We were eating up miles to the minute on the road to paradise<br />
All around was danger wrapped in the robes of false security<br />
But just ahead the pathway was golden as far as I could see

<div class="chorus">And there is so much sky<br />
So many paths to cross and bridges to burn<br />
So much sky<br />
Where our footsteps will be upon return</div>

Driving west into Ashland County we caught fire along with the clouds<br />
She said she was thinking of paradise but I know she was dreaming aloud<br />
I gave up my wisdom I gave up my power I gave up the Holy Ghost<br />
She said there is always a sunrise once the sunset has passed

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

There is a world just beyond our reach and there are kingdoms in the sky<br />
There are miracles untouched by humans and there are reasons why <br />
To see and to hold to hear what is told of the things not of this world<br />
There is more than is seen or felt, more than your ears have heard

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
