	<div class="lyrics">
Counting water towers from the back seat of a car<br />
Playing Take It to the Limit, it was 1984<br />
Colors and numbers, her ABCs<br />
But the things that she learned were more than any of these

<div class="chorus">Lessons learned in stories and songs<br />
Ways to take your mind off of what's going wrong<br />
How to begin all over again<br />
Who else could teach us all of these things</div>

They would hang on her every word<br />
Of deserts and jungles and the animal world<br />
And while she taught them to count past ten<br />
They learned that failure is just giving in

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

When she sang it was never alone<br />
Her voice blew darkness right out of this home<br />
Keeping the tempo, staying in key<br />
We learned how to live in harmony

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

How to live with mistakes you have made<br />
Ways to trick the monster out from under your bed<br />
How to behave like a human being<br />
These are the things that my mother taught me

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
