It's May, dogwood's blooming spring fever, first mowing<br />
Life is blooming, life is trying nobody thinks about dying<br />
Emotion bomb, flash of light upside down, inside out<br />
Guilty thoughts, am I dying is it me, yeah, I'm trying

<div class="chorus">Never laughed, he never cried never born, he never died<br />
Never skinned his knees played tag with the breeze<br />
But after all he's still my brother</div>

Yeah, it's time, back to dust same words, hypnotized<br />
Feeling hollow, feel like crying is the child in me dying?<br />
Gotta cry, just can't hold it mom, I would have told you<br />
I love you, and be sure that he does too

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Gift of grace, package of pain pick me up, put me down again<br />
God - why me, I've don't know hold me tight, I don't wanna let go<br />
What's it mean, I'm still finding answers aren't easy, if you're trying<br />
Pry off the shell, get to the pearl, but it hurts
