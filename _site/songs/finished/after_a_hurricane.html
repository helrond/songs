<strong>After a Hurricane</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
<div class="notes">for Albertville</div>
There were limbs down everywhere and those trees ain't coming back<br>
And people without power three weeks after the fact<br>
And on Sunday when it ripped through town howling like a train<br>
You closed your eyes and waited til you only heard the rain

<div class="chorus">You will have to think twice about where to turn that wheel<br>
You will have to get used to the way things look from here<br>
Because nothing you know will ever be the same<br>
After a hurricane</div>

After it was over, when all the lights were out<br>
You made your way down to the road to drive back into town<br>
Well they closed down the highway; cops were turning folks around<br>
And a line was coming down between then and now

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

The governor declared a state and called out the Guard<br>
And the President dropped by to let us know we would survive<br>
But we sweated out that summer in the Alabama sun<br>
Unemployed and with no way to pay for what must be done

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
