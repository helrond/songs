<strong>Death in the Family</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
You were still breathing when they cut your body down<br />
On a Friday afternoon<br />
And by the time that they called your mother down<br />
You had flown to the moon<br />
<br />
You were still screaming when they strapped your body down<br />
In a solitary room<br />
By the time we recaptured the saints from the sinners<br />
We'd killed more than a few

<div class="chorus">If the stones could cry out, who would they cry for<br />
Was it for this destiny that the spotless lamb was slain<br />
Whose brother's blood is this that cries out from the floor <br />
Why are we drawn like a moth to the flame</div>

Weighed in the balance you've been found wanting<br />
For more than your worth<br />
Now who can transform that stone hanging on your neck<br />
To heavenly bread<br />
<br />
How did it happed you woke up this morning<br />
Bloodthirsty pack on your trail<br />
The Hound of Heaven attacks without warning<br />
Bites without fail

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Raise high the standard of moral persuasion<br />
This civilized inquisition<br />
Chosen to burn for the sins that are handed down<br />
Your father's indiscretion

<div class="chorus">Some say no more victims, some no more abuse<br />
Some just want the facts, some just want the truth<br />
Some just want your blood, some want a vaccine<br />
Some want you swinging from a tree</div>

The world is more than jails and churches<br />
You are more than your word<br />
We never wanted to walk on water<br />
Or meant to take up the sword

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
