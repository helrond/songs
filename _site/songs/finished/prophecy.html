	<div class="lyrics">
I get tired of seeing my own face<br />
I get tired of feeling my constraints<br />
I get tired of hearing the lies<br />
I get tired of being paralyzed<br />
<br />
When did truth become relative to the imperial palace edifice<br />
When did love become hate and justice fate<br />
I want to know when life gave up the ghost<br />
When joy died in bed and science lost its head<br />
<br />
History is a parade of mistakes<br />
Government no more than we fake<br />
Beauty is on sale for less<br />
And murderer's weapons are become blessed<br />
<br />
<div class="chorus">When will the day come when we all will know<br />
That nothing stands between us and the way back home<br />
When will the day come when we all will see<br />
That all the thoughts we hold inside won't make us free<br />
<br />
Come let us go to the mountain of the lord<br />
Death will meet life and age to youth<br />
Where the hand of another will never hold a sword<br />
And we will walk in the light of truth</div><br />
<br />
Give me half a chance to gain my omnipotence<br />
Give yourself a chance to be more than indifferent<br />
Peace is taken out to die, hope is falling from the sky<br />
Joy is lost in the river's fall as justice takes the final call<br />
<br />
<div class="chorus">Come let us go to the mountain of the lord<br />
Death will meet life and age to youth<br />
Where the hand of another will never hold a sword<br />
And we will walk in the light of truth</div>
