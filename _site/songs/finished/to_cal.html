	<div class="lyrics">
You've seen him he stands there on the corner<br />
For hours holding his sign<br />
Nonviolence or nonexistence, Martin Luther King Jr.<br />
And people drive by like they're blind<br />
<br />
The winter's fast fading to springtime's parading<br />
There's been too many to pass this one by<br />
If I've hope for the future it might be for you and your<br />
Trust in the yellowing sky

<div class="chorus">Fly your battle flag high<br />
Tell those little boys it's noble to die<br />
Dress them in uniform <br />
Their mothers will cry on a tidy corpse</div>

You've been as far down as the best high can get<br />
They had you doped right out of your head<br />
You say it took a blood clot in your brain but now it's what you've got<br />
That makes all the rest of us mad<br />
<br />
It's your humble silence that gives me my sense<br />
That I let on much more than I know<br />
If you're an unarmed Christian in what position<br />
Does that leave this country's goal<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

It's the patterns of contradiction that might break our addiction<br />
To the gods of this heathen state<br />
It's a way of relation that might break this domination<br />
Before we throw up our hands and call it fate

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
