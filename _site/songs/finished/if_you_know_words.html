<strong>If You Know the Words</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
From the time that she was young<br />
You could hear her singing that song<br />
Says it was God that taught her heart<br />
She just had to stick to her part<br />
<br />
She sang with a voice all her own<br />
Keeping the faith and passing it on<br />
The good and bad times, the major, minor keys<br />
Change the words, but keep this melody

<div class="chorus">And if you know the words, then go ahead and sing it<br />
If you know the truth, then go ahead and live it<br />
Even if your voice is the only thing you own<br />
You've got more than enough if you've still got a song</div>

And on the day they lay her down<br />
To rise up to glory and that heavenly crown<br />
Still have a song on her lips, in her heart<br />
Still will be happy just to do her part

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Let me keep on singing the songs that I know<br />
Even if no one is listening, let me still carry on<br />
Not for fortune, glory or fame<br />
But just to keep on living and remembering my name

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
