	<div class="lyrics">
They are out there and<br />
They are going to get you<br />
You can find them anywhere<br />
But if you look you'll never see them<br />
<br />
We're here to protect you<br />
From them and their devices<br />
We are at your service<br />
In a time of constant crisis<br />
<br />
They are gunning for you<br />
You have what they want<br />
You are after all standing tall<br />
The first of the first world nations

<div class="chorus">I say it's not about being better than them<br />
I say it's not about keeping what you have from everyone else<br />
I say it's about having the courage to live like a human<br />
I say it's about being better than your own self</div>

If they should ever get you<br />
What will happen then<br />
Will you be tortured and burned till you wish you had died<br />
Or will you be just like them

<div class="chorus">I say it's not about being better than them<br />
I say it's not about keeping what you have from everyone else<br />
I say it's about having the courage to live like a human<br />
I say it's about being better than your own self</div>
