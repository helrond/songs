<strong>When the Flood Comes Down</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
There's a lot of people talking about what kind of mess we're in<br>
And people offering advice for which nobody asked them<br>
And people building dams, putting in wells and pumps<br>
But when the flood comes, the water's going to run where it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, you better find a boat<br>
When the flood comes down, something that floats<br>
When the flood comes down</div>

There's talk about public health and decency<br>
Respect for law and order and property<br>
People picking through the trash, building levees out of junk<br>
But when the flood comes, the water's going to cover what it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, you better hold that fort<br>
When the flood comes down, shut down that port<br>
When the flood comes down</div>

Some people live on nothing, some people got everything<br>
Some people pay attention, some people never learn a thing<br>
Some people claim to be something they are not<br>
But when the flood comes, the water's going to drown who it wants

<div class="chorus">When the flood comes down, you cannot hide<br>
When the flood comes down, from a rising tide<br>
When the flood comes down<br>
When the flood comes down, it will be washed away<br>
When the flood comes down, on that day<br>
When the flood comes down</div>
