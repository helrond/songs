Think I've lost faith in life being fair<br />
Lost hope in people who say they care<br />
I don't believe we're all created equally<br />
As long as someone governs someone else's right to be<br />
<br />
I've lost hope in the institutions of reform<br />
How can you make something out of something that's so wrong<br />
How can you smile even though you see the lies<br />
How can you say you're done when you haven't even tried<br />
<br />
As for religion tell me do you believe in the God<br />
In the churches or emerging from the sod<br />
Do your leaders lead by example or intimidation<br />
Do you hope for everyone's salvation<br />
<br />
What about the serenity in a bug crossing the road<br />
What about the beauty the flight of a sparrow showed<br />
What about hope in people to whom everything else is denied<br />
What about belief in a tomorrow that won't die<br />
<br />
I found faith in the dogwood in the spring<br />
Found hope in the purple of a pigeons wing<br />
I believe in the power of open minds<br />
To put us on a road and give us the signs<br />
<br />
I believe in a God that wants justice for all<br />
I believe in a hope that nothing can destroy<br />
I believe in love as a political tool<br />
I believe in the integrity of a fool<br />
<br />
I believe in sun, I believe in clouds, I believe in rain<br />
I believe in laughter, I believe in pain<br />
I believe that our night of hate and fear<br />
Is over and the dawn is already here
