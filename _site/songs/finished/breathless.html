	<div class="lyrics">
Do you ever get the feeling you're drowning like an elephant is on your chest<br />
Do you ever get the feeling you've found where the rainbow meets the dust<br />
And I wouldn't mind losing my lungs to you in exchange for a rib<br />
And I would give all of my power if death would lose its grip<br />
I tell you I'd give it all for more but I've given more for less<br />
If I am clay without your breath with you I am breathless<br />
<br />
Do you ever get the feeling you're falling and you'll never hit the ground<br />
Do you wonder then if you were screaming would you even hear the sound<br />
I still remember how you punched right through like I was paper thin<br />
Drained me dry until all that was left was the stain of my own sin<br />
I tell you I'd give it all for more but I've given more for less<br />
If I am clay without your breath with you I am breathless<br />
<br />
Do you ever get the feeling of hands around your neck<br />
Do you wonder if surrender is a way to escape death<br />
You and I together are the anvil and the steel<br />
And we are at eternal war like a spoke and a wheel<br />
I tell you I'd give it all for more but I've given more for less<br />
If I am clay without your breath with you I am breathless
