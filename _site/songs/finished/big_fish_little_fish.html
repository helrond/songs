<strong>Big Fish Little Fish</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
One fish two fish red fish blue fish big fish little fish<br />
Black fish blue fish old fish new fish a fish is a fish is a fish<br />
Sad fish glad fish very very bad fish fish from here to there<br />
Fat fish thin fish wearing yellow hat fish strange things everywhere<br />

<div class="chorus">When it's over it's over when it's through it's through<br />
When you're fighting and you don't know what for admit that you lose</div>

In the sea you've got two kinds of fish, big ones, little ones<br />
The big ones are sharks and such that kill and maim and steal<br />
And even though their methods are somewhat questionable<br />
All they're really trying to do is stay ahead of the game<br />
<br />
Now the little ones are, over all, a harmless sort<br />
They swim and eat and make more guppies when they're bored<br />
It's just that they got debts no honest fish could pay<br />
So they do a little something on the side to get them through each day<br />
<br />
So the bigger ones are doing damage, out there going wild<br />
And the little ones are on the corner struggling to stay alive<br />
But the little ones get blamed as always for the country's quandaries<br />
And they're chased all over the corners of the seven seas<br />
<br />
So the poor little fishes sit in jail while the big fish swim free<br />
And something about this bothers me something disagrees<br />
Why little fish always get sent up the creek<br />
And bigger ones get wine and cheese and victorian antiques<br />
<br />
Any fisherman knows that catching minnows is not sensible policy<br />
And guppies aren't exactly the predators in the sea<br />
So why is it the little ones get twenty five to life<br />
And the killers with their bloody hands get offered a knife<br />

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

That which we call a fish by any other name<br />
At the end of the day on the end of the line smells the same<br />
Little fish eaten by big fish is someone elses prey <br />
On the end of a line the biggest fish is not a white whale
