	<div class="lyrics">
It flew back via Paris with me<br />
And bought a cup of coffee, light and sweet<br />
I thought about the traces of my traveling<br />
About spending what was given to me

<div class="chorus">Every word you've left unspoken<br />
All you've bent and all you've broken<br />
Everything you've forgotten to do<br />
It comes back to you</div>

He must have known how it would end<br />
For smashing people's gods is not a way of making friends<br />
And I don't mind the tale of roses, fire and fish<br />
If the story's told while someone's listening

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

He struck the dust with his heel<br />
Water streamed, the desert bore sunflowers and wheat<br />
Now the acqueducts stretch on for miles beside the road<br />
And the dams into the distance as far as I can see

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

There will come a day and it won't be long<br />
When things that now are permanent will be gone<br />
Empires crack and crumble, deserts turn to seas<br />
What I've given will come back in a song

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>
