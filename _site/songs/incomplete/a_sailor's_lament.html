The jailer had too much to drink he was fast asleep by ten<br />
I stole his keys and let myself out of the holding pen<br />
Set out across the mountains, heading for the nearest port<br />
I knew it wouldn't be long until they filed a Missing Person's Report<br />
<br />
I stowed away on a schooner headed out at dawn<br />
To match wits with the future and beat it with my brawn<br />
We were somewhere near the Azores when a storm came up fast<br />
Blew our sails to shreds and broke off both our masts<br />
<br />
They found me in the cargo hold, pulled me out and sat me down<br />
I pulled out my flask of gin and passed it around<br />
Then someone said, "Hey I know you, I've seen your face before<br />
Oh yeah, it was on that poster on the wall at the General Store."<br />
<br />
I made like I had to leave, but they said I had to stay<br />
The ship began to founder, we all began to pray<br />
They said they had to lose some weight or the ship would surely sink<br />
So they threw me and my sins overboard into the drink<br />
<br />
I was never much of a swimmer, but I paddled around<br />
'Till I heard the captain shouting, "My God, we're all going down!"<br />
And through the waves I saw the ship dive into the deep<br />
The sea sucked me in it's gaping grin where many fell asleep<br />
<br />
And as the waves rolled over me the sky above was dark<br />
I screamed, "Don't call me Ishmael, don't call me Joan of Arc<br />
Don't call me a survivor, don't wish you'd died instead<br />
And far above all else, don't you dare call me dead"</div>
