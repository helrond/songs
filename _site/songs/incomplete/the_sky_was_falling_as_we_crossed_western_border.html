	<div class="lyrics">
The sky was falling as we crossed the western border<br />
You turned to me with a smile<br />
Though the world was drowning in half an inch of water<br />
I could see for miles and miles<br />
<br />
The earth was screaming as they poured across the border<br />
You were pointing at the moon<br />
And though the creek was rising and the southern bridge was washed out<br />
There was nothing ahead but _________<br />
<br />
The sea was raging when I heard the call to order<br />
You were dancing on the shore<br />
And though the wind had blown us nearly on the rock's teeth<br />
We were neither created nor destroyed<br />
<br />
If it looks like war and it talks like war and it walks like war and it smells like war<br />
<br />
God willing and the creek don't rise<br />
<br />
If love is a game it's the first one to zero that takes<br />
Everything but the girl<br />
Is it finite like energy and matter or as vast<br />
As an open hand
