<strong>Maybe I Was Right</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
Maybe I was right where I was right then<br />
But in two years I'll be gone<br />
And maybe all the places I've been to<br />
Only served to bring me here

<div class="chorus">Maybe I was right<br />
Maybe I was right<br />
Maybe I was right<br />
I was wrong</div>

Maybe all the things that I have lost<br />
Make room for the new<br />
Maybe all the people I forgot<br />
I was not meant to know

<div class="chorus">CHORUS</div>

Maybe the ideals that I have lost<br />
Were the ones I don't believe<br />
Maybe all the anger that is gone<br />
Was not sincerely felt
<div class="chords">C/Am<br />
F/Dm<br />
<br />
C/Am/C/G</div>
<br />
Maybe all the things that I regret<br />
<br />
Not the waiting, but the preparedness<br />
<br />
Confidence/assurity that I have lost<br />
<br />
Remember something else <br />
<br />
Mistakes I knew better than to make
