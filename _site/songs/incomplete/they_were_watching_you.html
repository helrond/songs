	<div class="lyrics">
You stood in the room where the paintings hung<br />
They were watching you<br />
Wondering if you were artist enough<br />
They were watching you<br />
Saint Sebastian lowered his head<br />
With a mischievous smile said son don't you know<br />
I've been watching you<br />
<br />
You sat yourself down in front of the screen<br />
They were watching you<br />
The pictures flickered in blue and green<br />
They were watching you<br />
The late night anchor turned in his chair<br />
And fixing you with his benevolent gaze said<br />
I've been watching you<br />
<br />
They gave it to you fast and rough<br />
They were watching you<br />
Questioning if you were man enough<br />
They were watching you<br />
Monuments of bones, mountains of shoes<br />
Skeletons dancing to the sound of Pan's flute<br />
They were watching you
