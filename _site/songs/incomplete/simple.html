It's easy to say that I know nothing at all<br />
And what I see may all of it be false<br />
It's easy to say that one and one is undefined<br />
But all we have to do each day is simply live this life<br />
<br />
It's easy to say you are the master of this plan<br />
And what you hold so dear is in your hand<br />
It's easy to say this is a miracle divine<br />
Because all we have to do each day is simply live this life<br />
<br />
I've tried to keep this short and sweet<br />
But the words keep flowing out of me<br />
It's such a mystery<br />
<br />
I've tried to slip my trembling grip<br />
But I love this life too muchv
Just like Odysseus<br />
<br />
I could be raised up<br />
Like I was Lazarusv
<br />
I've tried to keep this lecture brief<br />
<br />
Enter into life<br />
I am a simple man<br />
<br />
I know it's easy to say you believe in anything<br />
It's simpler still to just refuse
