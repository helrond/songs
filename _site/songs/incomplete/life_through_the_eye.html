<strong>Life Through the Eye</strong>

	<div class="lyrics">
In a furnished room on Centre Market the police radio is always on<br />
And a man sits there dozing listening for the night to fall<br />
While across the street the Black Marias haul in the killers, pimps and vagabonds<br />
Crowds will gather for a new disaster, lovers kiss and children turn to clowns<br />

<div class="chorus">Now he's been round to many places, has seen his share<br />
He has taken many pictures, proving he was there<br />
<br />
What could be better<br />
What could be better<br />
What could be better<br />
Than life through the eye</div>

Stalking down the darkened streets at midnight a 4x5 Speed Graphic round his neck<br />
Looking for a shot, some light, an angle; the perfect murder, fire or wreck<br />
Around the edge of every picture there's a darkness creeping in<br />
And a subject frozen sharp and focused in unconscious language gesturing

<div class"chorus">All the fire escapes and theaters, sirens and bells<br />
All the headlines in the paper, bleeding what they sell<br />
<br />
CHORUS<br />
<br />
He had photographs and tabloid papers like the ancient Greeks had families<br />
He put a signature on his creation and took a stab at immortality<br />
